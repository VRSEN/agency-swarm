# 🐝 Agency Swarm

![Framework](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vrsen-ai/o/public%2Fgithub%2FLOGO_BG_large_bold_shadow%20(1).jpg?alt=media&token=8c681331-2a7a-4a69-b21b-3ab1f9bf1a23)

## Overview

The **Agency Swarm Framework** is an advanced system for building multi-agent applications. It leverages and extends the foundational capabilities of the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python), providing specialized features for creating, orchestrating, and managing collaborative swarms of AI agents.

By default, Agency Swarm is built on the **OpenAI Responses API** to handle complex, multi-turn interactions, with `examples/chat_completion_provider.py` being the only exception that uses the Chat Completions API.

Agency Swarm enhances the underlying SDK by introducing:
- True agent collaboration with flexible, user-defined communication flows (orchestrator-workers pattern with async execution support).
- An `Agency` that uses an `agency_chart` to define complex communication flows and interaction patterns between agents.
- Flexible conversation persistence: Manage conversation history by providing `load_threads_callback` and `save_threads_callback` functions to the `Agency`, enabling threads to be loaded from and saved to external storage (e.g., a database). This allows conversations to continue across sessions, which is essential for production environments.
- A specialized `send_message` tool automatically configured for agents, enabling them to communicate based on the defined `agency_chart`.
- `agency_swarm.Agent` which extends the base SDK `Agent` with built-in file handling and sub-agent registration capabilities.

This framework continues the original vision of Arsenii Shatokhin (aka VRSEN) to simplify the creation of sophisticated AI agencies by thinking about automation in terms of real-world organizational structures.

**Migrating from v0.x?** Please see our [Migration Guide](./docs/migration_guide.mdx) for details on adapting your project to this new SDK-based version.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Agent Roles**: Define distinct agent roles (e.g., CEO, Developer) with tailored instructions, tools, and capabilities within the Agency Swarm framework, leveraging the underlying OpenAI Agents SDK.
- **Full Control Over Agent Instructions**: Maintain complete control over each agent's guiding prompts (instructions) for precise behavior customization.
- **Type-Safe Tools**: Develop robust tools using Pydantic models for automatic argument validation, compatible with the OpenAI Agents SDK's `FunctionTool` format.
- **Orchestrated Agent Communication**: Agents communicate via a dedicated `send_message` tool, with interactions governed by an `agency_chart` that defines allowed communication pathways within the `Agency`.
- **Flexible State Persistence**: Manage conversation history by providing `load_threads_callback` and `save_threads_callback` functions to the `Agency`. This allows for loading and saving conversation threads to external storage, enabling persistence across sessions.
- **Robust Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Build complex and reliable agent workflows by leveraging the OpenAI Agents SDK foundation, enhanced by Agency Swarm's structured orchestration layer.

## Installation

### Stable Version (v0.x)
```bash
pip install -U agency-swarm
```

### Beta Version (v1.x - OpenAI Agents SDK Based)
```bash
pip install -U agency-swarm==1.0.0-beta.3
```

> **Note:** The v1.x beta represents a major architectural change built on the OpenAI Agents SDK.
> While feature-complete and functional, it's marked as beta for wider testing before becoming the default version.
> See our [Migration Guide](https://agency-swarm.ai/migration/guide) for details on migrating from v0.x to v1.x.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Your OpenAI Key**:
    ```python
    from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
    set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

2. **Create Tools**:
Define your custom tools by extending the `BaseTool` class:
    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field

    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does.
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
        """

        # Define the fields with descriptions using Pydantic Field
        example_field: str = Field(
            ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
        )
        # Additional fields as required
        # ...

        def run(self):
            """
            The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
            """
            # Your custom tool logic goes here
            do_something(self.example_field)

            # Return the result of the tool's operation
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

    or convert from OpenAPI schemas:

    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory
    # using local file
    with open("schemas/your_schema.json") as f:
        tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(
            f.read(),
        )

    # using requests
    tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(
        requests.get("https://api.example.com/openapi.json").json(),
    )
    ```


3. **Define Agent Roles**: Start by defining the roles of your agents. For example, a CEO agent for managing tasks and a developer agent for executing tasks.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent

    ceo = Agent(
        name="CEO",
        description="Responsible for client communication, task planning and management.",
        instructions="You must converse with other agents to ensure complete task execution.", # can be a file like ./instructions.md
        files_folder="./files", # files to be uploaded to OpenAI
        schemas_folder="./schemas", # OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools
        tools=[MyCustomTool],
        temperature=0.3, # temperature for the agent
        max_prompt_tokens=25000, # max tokens in conversation history
    )
    ```

    Import from existing agents:

   ```bash
   agency-swarm import-agent --name "Devid" --destination "./"
   ```

   This will import Devid (Software Developer) Agent locally, including all source code files, so you have full control over your system. Currently, available agents are: `Devid`, `BrowsingAgent`.


4. **Define Agency Communication Flows**:
Establish how your agents will communicate with each other.

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency
    # if importing from local files
    from Developer import Developer
    from VirtualAssistant import VirtualAssistant

    dev = Developer()
    va = VirtualAssistant()

    agency = Agency([
            ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
            [ceo, dev],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
            [ceo, va],   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
            [dev, va]    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
        ],
        shared_instructions='agency_manifesto.md', # shared instructions for all agents
        temperature=0.3, # default temperature for all agents
        max_prompt_tokens=25000 # default max tokens in conversation history
    )
    ```

     In Agency Swarm, communication flows are directional, meaning they are established from left to right in the agency_chart definition. For instance, in the example above, the CEO can initiate a chat with the developer (dev), and the developer can respond in this chat. However, the developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO. The developer can initiate a chat with the virtual assistant (va) and assign new tasks.

5. **Run Demo**:
Run the demo to see your agents in action!

    Web interface:

    ```python
    agency.demo_gradio(height=900)
    ```

    Terminal version:

    ```python
    agency.run_demo()
    ```

    Backend version:

    ```python
    completion_output = agency.get_completion("Please create a new website for our client.")
    ```

# CLI

## Genesis Agency

The `genesis` command starts the genesis agency in your terminal to help you create new agencies and agents.

#### **Command Syntax:**

```bash
agency-swarm genesis [--openai_key "YOUR_API_KEY"]
```

Make sure to include:
- Your mission and goals.
- The agents you want to involve and their communication flows.
- Which tools or APIs each agent should have access to, if any.

## Importing Existing Agents

This CLI command allows you to import existing agents from local files into your agency.

#### **Command Syntax:**

```bash
agency-swarm import-agent --name "AgentName" --destination "/path/to/directory"
```

To check available agents, simply run this command without any arguments.

## Creating Agent Templates Locally

This CLI command simplifies the process of creating a structured environment for each agent.

#### **Command Syntax:**

```bash
agency-swarm create-agent-template --name "AgentName" --description "Agent Description" [--path "/path/to/directory"] [--use_txt]
```

### Folder Structure

When you run the `create-agent-template` command, it creates the following folder structure for your agent:

```
/your-specified-path/
│
├── agency_manifesto.md or .txt # Agency's guiding principles (created if not exists)
└── AgentName/                  # Directory for the specific agent
    ├── files/                  # Directory for files that will be uploaded to openai
    ├── schemas/                # Directory for OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools
    ├── tools/                  # Directory for tools to be imported by default.
    ├── AgentName.py            # The main agent class file
    ├── __init__.py             # Initializes the agent folder as a Python package
    ├── instructions.md or .txt # Instruction document for the agent
    └── tools.py                # Custom tools specific to the agent's role.

```

This structure ensures that each agent has its dedicated space with all necessary files to start working on its specific tasks. The `tools.py` can be customized to include tools and functionalities specific to the agent's role.

## Future Enhancements

1. [x] Creation of agencies that can autonomously create other agencies.
2. [x] Asynchronous communication and task handling.
3. [ ] Inter-agency communication for a self-expanding system.
