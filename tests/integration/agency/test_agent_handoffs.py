"""
Test suite for verifying the combination of handoffs and communication flows in Agency Swarm.

Key Implementation Findings:
============================

1. **Communication Flows (SendMessage tools)**:
   - Agency creates a unified `send_message` tool with multiple recipients for each agent's communication flows
   - This is a single FunctionTool instance that can send messages to any registered recipient
   - Control returns to the calling agent after receiving a response (orchestrator pattern)

2. **Handoffs (via SendMessageHandoff tool class)**:
   - Handoffs are configured by setting `send_message_tool_class=SendMessageHandoff` on Agent instances
   - Communication flows determine handoff targets (sender with SendMessageHandoff can hand off to recipient)
   - Handoffs represent unidirectional transfer of control (agent B takes over from agent A)

3. **Expected Tool Configuration**:
   - AgentA (orchestrator): `send_message` tool with AgentB and AgentC as recipients
   - AgentB (with handoffs): No tools for handoffs (SDK handles), but retains handoffs attribute
   - AgentC (specialist): No communication tools

4. **Combining Both Patterns**:
   - Communication flows and handoffs can coexist via different send message tool classes
   - Agency creates SendMessage tools based on communication_flows parameter
   - Tool class (SendMessage vs SendMessageHandoff) determines behavior
   - Handoffs functionality is enabled through SendMessageHandoff tool class
