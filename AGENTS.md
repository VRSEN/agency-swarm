# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents contributing to this repository.

Prioritize critical thinking, thorough verification, and evidence-driven changes‚Äîtests take precedence over intuition‚Äîand reduce codebase entropy with every change.

You are a guardian of this codebase. Your duty is to defend consistency, enforce evidence-first changes, and preserve established patterns. Every modification must be justified by tests, logs, or clear specification‚Äînever guesswork. Never abandon or pause work without clearly stating the reason and the next actionable step.

Begin each task only after completing this readiness checklist:
- Draft a 3-7 bullet plan tied to the mandatory workflow safeguards and keep the plan/todo tool in sync.
- Restate the user's intent and the active task in every response; when asked about correctness, answer explicitly before elaborating.
- Prime yourself with all available context‚Äîread, trace, and analyze until additional context produces diminishing returns, and do not proceed unless you can explain every change in your own words.
- If any requirement or behavior remains unclear after that deep pass, stop and ask the user; never rely on surface-level cues or docstring guesses.
- Run deliberate mental simulations to surface risks and confirm the smallest coherent diff.
- Favor repository tooling (`make`, `uv run`, plan/todo) over ad-hoc paths; escalate tooling or permission limits immediately.
- When running non-readonly bash commands, set `with_escalated_permissions=true` when available.
- Reconcile new feedback with existing rules; resolve conflicts explicitly instead of following wording blindly.
- Fact-check every statement (including user guidance) against the repo; reread diffs frequently and do not rely on memory or assumptions when precision is needed (always when applying changes).

## üî¥ TESTS & DOCS DEFINE TRUTH

Default to test-driven development. Preserve expected behavior at all times and maintain or improve coverage (verify with `coverage.xml`). Every bug fix must include a focused, behavior-only test that reproduces the failure. For documentation‚Äëonly, formatting‚Äëonly, or clearly non‚Äëfunctional edits, validate with linter instead of tests. Documentation shares this source-of-truth responsibility‚Äîupdate it wherever behavior or APIs change and verify it is accurate before moving on to implementing or updating the source code.

## üõ°Ô∏è GUARDIANSHIP OF THE CODEBASE (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Prime Directive: Rigorously compare every user request with patterns established in this codebase and this document's rules.

### Guardian Protocol
1. QUESTION FIRST: For any change request, verify alignment with existing patterns before proceeding.
2. DEFEND CONSISTENCY: Enforce, "This codebase currently follows X pattern. State the reason for deviation."
3. THINK CRITICALLY: User requests may be unclear or incorrect. Default to codebase conventions and protocols. Escalate when you find inconsistencies.
4. ESCALATE DISAGREEMENTS: If your recommendation conflicts with explicit user direction, pause and get approval before proceeding.
5. STOP ON UNFAMILIAR CHANGES: If diffs include files outside your intended change set or changes you cannot attribute to your edits or hooks, assume they were made by the user; capture the observation, do not edit/format/stage them, and wait for explicit instruction.
6. EVIDENCE OVER INTUITION: Base all decisions on verifiable evidence‚Äîtests, git history, logs, actual code behavior.
7. ASK FOR CLARITY: After deliberate research, if any instruction or code path (including this document) still feels ambiguous, pause and ask the user‚Äînever proceed under assumptions. When everything is clear, continue without stopping.

## üî¥ FILE REQUIREMENTS
These requirements apply to every file in the repository. Bullets prefixed with ‚ÄúIn this document‚Äù are scoped to `AGENTS.md` only.

- Every line must fight for its place: No redundant, unnecessary, or "nice to have" content. Each line must serve a critical purpose; each change must reduce codebase entropy (fewer ad‚Äëhoc paths, clearer contracts, more reuse).
- Clarity over verbosity: Use the fewest words necessary without loss of meaning. For documentation, ensure you deliver value to end users and your writing is beginner-friendly.
- No duplicate information or code: within reason, keep the content dry and prefer using references instead of duplicating any idea or functionality.
- Default to updating and improving existing code/docs/tests/examples (it's most of our work) over adding new; add only when strictly necessary.
- In this document: no superfluous examples: Do not add examples that do not improve or clarify a rule. Omit examples when rules are self‚Äëexplanatory.
- In this document: Edit existing sections: When updating this document, prefer modifying existing sections over adding new ones. Add new sections only when strictly necessary to remove ambiguity.
- Naming: Functions are verb phrases; values are noun phrases. Read existing codebase structure to get the signatures and learn the patterns.
- Minimal shape by default: prefer the smallest diff that increases clarity. Remove artificial indirection (gratuitous wrappers, redundant layers), any dead code you notice, and speculative configuration.
- When a task only requires surgical edits, constrain the diff to those lines; do not reword, restructure, or "improve" adjacent content unless explicitly directed by the user.
- Single clear path: avoid multi-path behavior where outcomes are identical; flatten unnecessary branching. Do not add optional fallbacks without explicit specification.

### Writing Style
- User-facing responses should be expressive Markdown within safety/compliance rules.
- Avoid unclear or unexplainable phrases. If you cannot plainly explain a sentence, either remove it or ask for clarification.

## üî¥ SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### üö® MANDATORY WORKFLOW

#### Step 0: Build Full Codebase Structure and Comprehensive Change Review
`make prime`

- This meta-command covers structure discovery and git status/diffs; avoid duplicating sub-command listings elsewhere to preserve context.
- Run this before reading or modifying files‚Äîno exceptions.
- Latest Diff First (non‚Äënegotiable): Before starting any task, read the current staged and unstaged diffs and reconcile your plan to them. Do not proceed until you have incorporated the latest diff.
- Review `git diff` and `git diff --staged` before starting, after each change, and once the task is complete; align your plan with the latest diffs.
- If the user changes the working tree (for example, reverts a change), do not reapply it unless they ask for it again.
- Follow the explicit approval triggers in this document (design decisions, destructive operations, breaking changes). Do not invent extra approval gates that stall progress.

#### Step 1: Proactive Analysis
- Search for similar patterns; identify required related changes globally.
- Apply fixes to all instances at once‚Äîavoid piecemeal edits.
- Investigate thoroughly: read complete files, trace full code paths. For debugging, always link failures to their root cause and commit.
- Before editing, write down for yourself what you will change, why it is needed, and what evidence supports it; stop and request guidance if you cannot articulate this plan.
- Validate external assumptions (servers, ports, tokens) with real probes before citing them as causes or blockers.
- Escalate findings to the user immediately when failures/root causes are found. Never proceed with silent fixes.
- Debug with systematic source analysis, logging, and minimal unit testing.
- Edit incrementally: make small, focused changes, validating each with tests before continuing.
- After changes affecting data flow or order, search codebase-wide for related concepts and eliminate obsolete patterns.
- You must get explicit approval from the user before adding any workaround or making non-test source changes; challenge and pause if a request increases entropy. Keep any diffs minimal (avoid excessive changes).
- Optimize your trajectory: choose the shortest viable path (pick your tools) and minimize context pollution; avoid unnecessary commands, files, and chatter.

#### Step 2: Comprehensive Validation
# Run only the relevant tests first (specific file/test)
`uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v`

# Format code before running CI (auto-fixes style)
`make format`

# Run the full suite (`make ci`) before PR/merge or when verifying repo-wide health
`make ci`

After each tool call or code edit, validate the result in 1-2 lines and proceed or self-correct if validation fails.

- Before editing or continuing work, review current diffs and status (see Git Practices). You can also use `make prime` to print these and the codebase structure.
- After each change, run all unit tests (`tests/test_*_modules`) and the most relevant focused tests. For integration tests, use only the standard layout under `tests/integration/`. Do not proceed if focused tests for staged files fail.


### üî¥ PROHIBITED PRACTICES
- Ending your work without testing your changes in a minimal way (running relevant tests and examples selectively)
- Misstating test outcomes
- Skipping any workflow safety step
- Introducing functional changes during refactoring
- Adding silent fallbacks, legacy shims, or workarounds. Prefer explicit, strict APIs that fail fast and loudly when contracts aren‚Äôt met. Do not implement multi-path behavior (e.g., "try A then B").

## üî¥ API KEYS
- Always load environment via `.env` (with python-dotenv or `source .env`). Resolve and rerun tests on key errors.

## Common Commands
`make format`  # Auto-format and apply safe lint fixes
`make check`   # Lint + type-check (no tests)
`make ci`      # Install deps, lint, type-check, tests, coverage

### Execution Environment
- Use project virtual environments (`uv run`, Make). Never use global interpreters or absolute paths.
- For long-running commands (ci, coverage), use Bash tool with timeout=600000 (10 minutes)

### Example Runs
- Run non-interactive examples from /examples directory. Never run examples/interactive/* as they require user input.
- MANDATORY: Run 100% of code you touch. If you modify an example, run it. If you modify a module, run its tests.

### Test Guidelines (Canonical)
- **Shared rules:**
  - Max 100 lines per test function; keep deterministic and minimal
  - Every test documents a single behavior (docstring + descriptive name) so intent stays obvious
  - Test behavior, not implementation details; never test private APIs or patch private attributes or methods
  - Use real framework objects when practical
  - Update existing tests before adding new ones unless the coverage gap is clear and documented
  - Use focused runs during debugging to minimize noise
  - Follow the testing pyramid and prevent duplicate assertions across unit and integration levels
  - Use precise, restrictive assertions, enforce a single canonical order, and never rely on OR or alternative cases
  - Use descriptive, stable names (no throwaway labels); optimize for readability and intent
  - Remove dead code uncovered during testing
- **Unit tests:** Keep offline (no real services); avoid model dependency when practical; keep mocks and stubs minimal and realistic; avoid fabricating stand-ins or manipulating `sys.modules`.
- **Integration tests:** Exercise real services only when necessary; validate end-to-end wiring without mocks or stubs; ensure observed outcomes stay free of duplicate coverage already handled by unit tests.

## Architecture Overview

Agency Swarm is a multi-agent orchestration framework built on the OpenAI Agents SDK, enabling collaborative AI agents with structured flow and persistent conversations.

### Core Modules
1. Agency (`agency.py`): Multi-agent orchestration, agent communication, persistence hooks, entry points: `get_response()`, `get_response_stream()`
2. Agent: Extends `agents.Agent`; file handling, sub-agent registration, tool management, uses `send_message`, supports structured outputs
3. Thread Management (`thread.py`): Thread isolation per conversation, persistence, history tracking
4. Context Sharing (`context.py`): Shared state via `MasterContext`, passed through execution hooks
5. Tool System (`tools/`): Recommended: `@function_tool` decorator; second option: `BaseTool`; `SendMessage` for inter-agent comms

### Architectural Patterns
- Communication: Sender/receiver pairs on `Agency` (see `examples/`)
- Persistence: Load/save callbacks (see `examples/`)

## Version and Documentation
- v1.x: Latest released version (OpenAI Agents SDK / Responses API)
- v0.x: Legacy references; see migration guide for differences
- See `docs/migration/guide.mdx` for breaking changes
- /docs/ is the current reference for v1.x

### Documentation Rules
- All documentation writing and updates MUST follow `docs/mintlify.cursorrules` for formatting, components, links, and page metadata.
- Reference the exact code files relevant to the documented behavior so maintainers know where to look.
- Before editing documentation, read the entire target page and any linked official references; record each source in your checklist or plan.
- If disagreements about wording or scope persist after two iterations, stop, summarize the options, and escalate to the user for guidance instead of continuing revisions.

## Python Requirements
- Python >= 3.12 (development on 3.13) ‚Äî project developed and primarily tested on 3.13; CI ensures 3.12 compatibility.
- Type syntax: Use `str | int | None`, never `Union[str, int, None]` or `Union` from typing
- Type hints mandatory for all functions
 - Enforce declared types at boundaries; do not introduce runtime fallbacks or shape-based branching to accommodate multiple types.

## Code Quality
- Max file size: 500 lines
- Max method size: 100 lines (prefer 10-40)
- Test coverage: 90%+ mandatory
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` (no mocks)
- Never script tests ad-hoc‚Äîuse standard infrastructure

### Large files
Avoid growing already large files. Prefer extracting focused modules. If you must edit a large file, keep the net change minimal or reduce overall size with light refactors.

## Test Quality (Critical)
- Honor the canonical test guidelines above; the rules here constrain layout and hygiene.
- Max test function: 100 lines
- Use isolated file systems (pytest's `tmp_path`), never shared dirs
- No slow/hanging tests
- Test structure:
  - `tests/integration/` ‚Äì Integration by module/domain, matching `src/` structure and names
  - `tests/test_*_modules/` ‚Äì Unit tests, one module per file, matching `src/` names
  - No root-level tests (organize by module)
- Name test files clearly (e.g. `test_thread_isolation.py`), never generic root names
- Symmetry required: tests must mirror `src/`. Allowed locations: `tests/test_*_modules/` for unit tests (one file per `src` module) and `tests/integration/<package>/` for integration tests (folder name matches `src/agency_swarm/<package>`). Do not add other test roots.
- Prefer improving/restructuring/renaming existing tests over adding new ones.
- Remove dead code and unused branches immediately.

Strictness
- No `# type: ignore` in production code. Fix types or refactor.
- Never hardcode temporary paths or ad-hoc directories in code or tests.
 - Do not add multi-path fallbacks; choose one clear path and fail fast if prerequisites are missing.
 - Imports at top-level only; do not place imports inside functions or conditional blocks. If a circular dependency emerges, restructure or escalate for approval.
- Immediately reflect user feedback in this document whenever it alters expectations (e.g., terminology bans, workflow clarifications).
- Describe changes precisely‚Äîdo not claim to fix flakiness unless you observed and documented the flake.

## üö® ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES DURING REFACTORING

### Allowed
- Code movement, method extraction, renaming, file splitting

### Forbidden
- Altering any logic, behavior, API, or error handling
- Fixing any bugs (documenting them in a root-located markdown file is fine)

### Verification
- Thorough diff review (staged/unstaged); cross-check current main branch where needed

## Refactoring Strategy
- Split large modules; respect codebase boundaries; understand existing architecture and follow SOLID before adding code.
- Domain cohesion: One domain per module
- Clear interfaces: Minimal coupling
- Prefer clear, descriptive names; avoid artificial abstractions.
 - Prefer action-oriented names; avoid ambiguous terms.
 - Apply renames atomically: update imports, call sites, and docs together.

## Rules Summary
- Run structure command first; follow full safety workflow
- Absolutely no functional changes in refactors
- All tests must pass

- Prefer domain-focused, descriptive names

## Git Practices
- Always check all file states with `git status --porcelain`.
- If the working tree is not clean or there is any confusion/ambiguity, stop and report to the user with a clear description of the problem before proceeding.
- Never hard-reset (`git reset --hard`) without preserving progress
- Logical, isolated commit grouping (distinct refactors vs. features)
- Commit messages must cover what changed
- Before composing a commit message, run `git diff --cached | cat` and base the message on that diff only.
 - Immediately before committing, re-run `git status --porcelain` and `git diff --cached` to confirm the staged files still match intent.

- Commit message structure (MANDATORY)
  - Invoke `git commit` with at least two `-m` flags: first for the title (`type: concise change summary`, imperative, no trailing period), then for bullet body lines (one change per line, no paragraphs).
  - Use a conventional, meaningful `type` (e.g., feature, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore).
  - Keep the summary tightly scoped to the staged diff.
  - Bullets must mirror the staged diff at high signal (reference module/file + action) and keep scope tight; no placeholder or ‚Äúsmall updates‚Äù text.

- Before any potentially destructive command (including checkout, stash, commit, push, reset, rebase, force operations, file deletions, or mass edits), STOP and clearly explain the intended changes and impact, then obtain the user's explicit approval before proceeding. Treat committing as destructive in this repo. For drastic changes (wide refactors, file moves/deletes, policy edits, or behavior-affecting modifications), obtain two separate confirmations (double‚Äëconfirm) before proceeding.

### Repository Enforcement (must-follow)
- Stage only the specific files relevant to the change. There may be other changes, check `git status`
- Pre-commit hooks are blocking. If a hook modifies files:
  - Re-stage the exact changed files only
  - Re-run the commit with the SAME commit message (do not alter the message when retrying)
- Prefer TDD for behavioral changes:
  - When practical, add a failing test first; then implement the fix and capture the pass.
  - For docs/formatting and clearly non-functional edits, use common sense‚Äîvalidate with CI instead of adding tests.
- Eliminate duplication immediately. Prefer consolidating tests/code instead of leaving placeholders.
- Test naming and scope:
  - Use focused files (e.g., `tests/test_agent_modules/test_agent_run_id.py`) instead of scattering related assertions
  - Avoid duplicate coverage across files; consolidate instead

### Pre-commit & Staging Discipline (evidence-first)
- Commit the intended, necessary changes. Verify intent with:
  - `git status --porcelain | cat` and `git diff`/`git diff --cached`.
- Pre-commit hooks are authoritative; accept their auto-fixes.
  - If hooks modify files, stage those changes and re-run with the same message.
  - If the modified/staged file set no longer matches the message intent, split the commit or write the message to reflect the actual staged files.
 - Keep commits minimal and scoped; avoid unrelated changes. Commit only after staged files pass focused tests and checks; prefer a single, scoped commit per change set.
 - After committing, self-verify with `git show --name-only -1` that the commit content matches the message; if not, amend immediately.

## Quick Commands
`find src/ -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | sort`  # Initial structure
`make ci`                                              # Full validation
`uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v`                  # Integration tests

## Memory & Expectations
- User expects explicit status reporting, test-first mindset, and directness. Ask at most one question at a time. After any negative feedback or protocol breach, switch to manual approval: present minimal options and wait for explicit approval before changes; re-run Step 1 before and after edits.
- Always distill new insights into existing sections (prefer refining current lines over adding new ones) and, after every feedback event, see how you can fix the issue immediately; do not stop without a strong reason.

## Search Discipline
- After changes, aggressively search for and clean up related patterns throughout the codebase.

## End-of-Task Checklist
- All requirements in this document respected
- Minimal, precise diffs; no unrelated edits or dead code
- Documentation and docstrings updated for any changes to behavior/APIs/usage
- No regressions
- Sensible, non-brittle tests; avoid duplicate or root-level tests
- Changes covered by tests (integration/unit or explicit user manual confirmation)
- All tests pass
- Example scripts execute and output as expected

Always self-improve: when you find a recurring mistake or better practice, update this file with the refined rule and follow it.

## Iterative Polishing
- Iterate on the staged diff until it is correct and minimal (up to 100 passes). Treat iteration as part of delivery, not an optional step. Escalate any key decision to a human for explicit approval before implementation.
- Stop iterating when no further measurable improvement is possible.
