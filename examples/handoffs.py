Handoffs Example

This example demonstrates a realistic handoff workflow using SendMessageHandoff.

- DevLead implements features and hands off security-sensitive work to SecurityEngineer (default reminder)
- SecurityEngineer performs audits and hands off to ComplianceOfficer (reminder disabled)
- ComplianceOfficer completes compliance checks and hands back to DevLead, triggering a custom reminder for DevLead

Run with: python examples/handoffs.py

Try: "Implement user authentication with 2FA and ensure it passes security and compliance."
