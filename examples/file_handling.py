"""
Modern File Handling & Vision Example

This example demonstrates Agency Swarm's built-in capabilities for:
1. PDF file attachment processing (OpenAI automatically extracts content)
2. Image vision analysis using input_image format
3. No custom tools required - OpenAI handles everything automatically
