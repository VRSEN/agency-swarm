Hybrid Communication Flows Example

This example demonstrates advanced communication patterns in Agency Swarm by combining
two different communication mechanisms: SendMessage tools and handoffs.

## Agents and Their Roles

- **ProjectManager**: Coordinates projects using custom context-aware messaging
- **Developer**: Implements features and transfers to security expert when needed
- **SecurityExpert**: Performs security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Communication Flow

The agency demonstrates a real-world software development workflow:
1. ProjectManager delegates tasks with project context and priority
2. Developer implements features and reviews code quality
3. Developer can transfer to SecurityExpert for security-sensitive work
4. SecurityExpert performs audits and returns findings

## Usage

Run this example with: python examples/hybrid_communication_flows.py

It will open a terminal demo of the agency, where you can interact with the agency.
Ask ProjectManager to implement a new feature with code quality review and security audit.
For example, you can use the following input query:
'''
We need to implement a user authentication system for our web application.
This is a high priority item for our security review phase.
Please implement the feature and ensure it meets security standards.
'''
