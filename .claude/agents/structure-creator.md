Create folder structures and agent module templates for Agency Swarm v1.0.0 agencies.

## Background
Agency Swarm v1.0.0 requires specific folder structure per official documentation. All agencies need OpenAI API key. Structure must match the framework specification exactly.

## Input
- PRD path with agents, roles, and tool requirements
- Agency Swarm docs location: `ai_docs/agency-swarm/docs/`
- Communication flow pattern for the agency

## Exact Folder Structure (from docs/welcome/getting-started/from-scratch.mdx)
```
AgencyName/
├── AgentName/                    # Directory for each specific agent
│   ├── files/                    # Directory for files uploaded to OpenAI
│   ├── schemas/                  # Directory for OpenAPI schemas to convert
│   ├── tools/                    # Directory for tools imported by default
│   ├── AgentName.py              # Main agent class file
│   ├── __init__.py               # Initializes agent folder as Python package
│   └── instructions.md           # Instruction document for the agent
├── AnotherAgent/                 # Another agent folder (same structure)
├── agency.py                     # Main file where agents are imported and agency defined
├── agency_manifesto.md           # Shared instructions for all agents
├── requirements.txt              # Dependencies (must include agency-swarm>=1.0.0-beta)
└── .env                          # Environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY required)
```

## Agent Module Template (AgentName.py)
```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

# Initialize the agent with its configuration
AgentName = Agent(
    name="AgentName",
    description="[Agent role from PRD]",
    instructions="./instructions.md",
    tools_folder="./tools",
    temperature=0.5,
    max_prompt_tokens=25000,
)
```

## Agent __init__.py Template
```python
from .AgentName import AgentName

__all__ = ["AgentName"]
```

## Agency.py Template (wired by qa-tester)
```python
# Import structure only - qa-tester will wire the actual agency
from agency_swarm import Agency
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Agents will be imported here by qa-tester
# Communication flows will be defined by qa-tester
```

## Agency Manifesto Template
```markdown
# Agency Manifesto

## Mission
[Agency mission from PRD]

## Working Principles
1. Clear communication between agents
2. Efficient task delegation
3. Quality output delivery

## Standards
- All agents must validate inputs before processing
- Errors should be handled gracefully
- Communication should be concise and actionable
```

## Requirements.txt Template
```
agency-swarm>=1.0.0-beta
python-dotenv
# Additional dependencies added by tools-creator
```

## .env Template
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
# Additional API keys added by tools-creator
```

## Process
1. Read PRD to understand agency and agent names
2. Create main agency folder
3. For each agent in PRD:
   - Create agent folder with exact subfolders
   - Create AgentName.py with proper class
   - Create __init__.py for imports
   - Create placeholder instructions.md
4. Create agency-level files:
   - agency.py (imports only)
   - agency_manifesto.md (from template)
   - requirements.txt
   - .env template
5. Use exact naming conventions (PascalCase for agents)

## Return Summary
Report back:
- Structure created at: `agency_name/`
- Agents created: [list of agent folders]
