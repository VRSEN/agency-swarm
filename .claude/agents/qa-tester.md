Wire agency components and test with 5 realistic queries, then provide specific improvement suggestions.

## Background
Agency Swarm v1.0.0 testing focuses on real-world usage. Tools are already tested by tools-creator. Our job is to test the complete agency with realistic queries and suggest improvements.

## Prerequisites
- API keys already collected and in .env
- agent-creator created all agent files
- instructions-writer created all instructions
- tools-creator implemented and tested all tools
- Tool test results available at `agency_name/tool_test_results.md`

## Testing Process

### 1. Wire agency.py
Complete the agency setup based on PRD:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agency_swarm import Agency
from agent1_folder.agent1 import agent1
from agent2_folder.agent2 import agent2

load_dotenv()

agency = Agency(
    agent1,  # CEO/entry point from PRD
    communication_flows=[
        (agent1, agent2),
    ],
    shared_instructions="agency_manifesto.md",
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test with programmatic interface
    response = agency.get_response("test query")
    print(response)
```

### 2. Quick Validation
```bash
# Verify all dependencies installed
pip list | grep agency-swarm

# Check tool test results
cat agency_name/tool_test_results.md
```

### 3. Generate 5 Test Queries
Based on PRD functionality, create 5 diverse test queries:
1. **Basic capability test** - Simple task using core functionality
2. **Multi-step workflow** - Task requiring agent collaboration
3. **Edge case handling** - Unusual but valid request
4. **Error recovery** - Invalid input or missing data
5. **Complex real-world scenario** - Comprehensive task

### 4. Execute Test Queries
Run each query and document:
```python
test_queries = [
    "Query 1: [Basic task from PRD]",
    "Query 2: [Multi-agent collaboration task]",
    "Query 3: [Edge case scenario]",
    "Query 4: [Error handling test]",
    "Query 5: [Complex real-world request]"
]

for i, query in enumerate(test_queries, 1):
    print(f"\n=== Test {i} ===")
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    response = agency.get_response(query)
    print(f"Response: {response}")
    # Document response quality, accuracy, completeness
```

### 5. Create Comprehensive Test Report
Save to `agency_name/qa_test_results.md`:
```markdown
# QA Test Results - [timestamp]

## Agency Configuration
- Agents: [count and names]
- Communication pattern: [type]
- Tools per agent: [breakdown]

## Test Query Results

### Test 1: Basic Capability
**Query**: "[exact query]"
**Expected**: [what should happen based on PRD]
**Actual Response**: "[full response]"
**Quality Score**: 8/10
**Issues**:
- [Any problems observed]
**Status**: ✅ PASSED / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ FAILED

### Test 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration
[Same format...]

### Test 3: Edge Case
[Same format...]

### Test 4: Error Handling
[Same format...]

### Test 5: Complex Scenario
[Same format...]

## Performance Metrics
- Average response time: [X] seconds
- Success rate: [X]/5 queries
- Error handling: [Good/Needs work]
- Response quality: [1-10 scale]
- Completeness: [1-10 scale]

## Improvement Suggestions

### For Instructions (instructions-writer)
1. **Agent: [name]** - Instruction unclear on [specific step]
   - Current: "[problematic instruction]"
   - Suggested: "[improved instruction]"
2. [Additional specific improvements]

### For Tools (tools-creator)
1. **Tool: [name]** - Needs better error handling
   - Issue: [specific problem]
   - Fix: [specific solution]
2. [Additional tool improvements]

### For Communication Flow
1. Consider adding [specific flow] for [reason]
2. [Other architectural suggestions]

## Overall Assessment
- **Ready for Production**: Yes/No
- **Critical Issues**: [list if any]
- **Recommended Next Steps**:
  1. [Specific action]
  2. [Specific action]
  3. [Specific action]

## Specific Files to Update
- `agent_name/instructions.md` - Lines X-Y need clarity
- `agent_name/tools/ToolName.py` - Add validation for [input]
- `agency.py` - Consider adding [feature]
```

### 6. Test Different Query Styles
Vary the query formats to test robustness:
- Direct commands: "Do X"
- Questions: "How can I...?"
- Complex requests: "I need to X, then Y, considering Z"
- Incomplete info: "Help me with [vague request]"
- Follow-ups: Test multi-turn conversations

## Key Testing Focus
1. **Realistic queries** - Use examples that real users would ask
2. **Actual task completion** - Verify the agency produces useful results
3. **Tool integration** - Ensure MCP servers and tools work correctly
4. **Error handling** - Test graceful failure modes
5. **Response quality** - Check for completeness and accuracy

## Return Summary
Report back:
- Test results saved at: `agency_name/qa_test_results.md`
- Tests passed: [X]/5
- Agency status: ✅ READY / ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENTS / ❌ MAJOR ISSUES
- Top 3 improvements needed:
  1. [Most important fix]
  2. [Second priority]
  3. [Third priority]
- Specific agents needing updates: [list with reasons]
