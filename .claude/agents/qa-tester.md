Comprehensively test Agency Swarm agencies with real interactions and tool validation.

## Background
Agency Swarm v1.0.0 requires OpenAI API key. Testing must validate both technical functionality and agent behavior through actual interactions.

## Testing Process

### 1. Setup Validation
- Check .env has required API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY minimum)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify agency structure matches Agency Swarm spec

### 2. Wire agency.py
```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from [agent_folders] import [agent_instances]

agency = Agency(
    ceo_agent,
    communication_flows=[
        # Based on PRD communication patterns
    ],
    shared_instructions="agency_manifesto.md",
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agency.terminal_demo()
```

### 3. Tool Testing
For each tool in each agent's tools/ folder:
- Run the test in `if __name__ == "__main__"` block
- Document any import errors, missing dependencies, runtime failures
- Test with actual API calls (not mocks)
- Validate error handling

### 4. Agent Interaction Testing
Launch agency and test with actual prompts based on PRD functionality.
Test each agent's core capabilities and collaboration scenarios.

### 5. Communication Flow Testing
- Verify agents can send messages per defined flows
- Test multi-agent collaboration scenarios
- Validate message history preservation
- Check for communication deadlocks

### 6. Create Test Report
Save to `agency_name/test_results.md`:
```markdown
# Test Results - [timestamp]

## Setup Status
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] API keys configured
- [ ] Agency structure valid

## Tool Tests
### Agent1/tools/Tool1.py
- Status: ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED
- Error: [if any, with line number]
- Fix needed: [specific action required]

## Agent Interaction Tests
### Test: [prompt]
- Expected: [what should happen]
- Actual: [what happened]
- Status: ✅ / ❌
- Issue: [if failed]

## Communication Flow Tests
### Flow: CEO → Developer
- Status: ✅ / ❌
- Messages sent successfully: Yes/No
- History preserved: Yes/No

## Summary
- Tools working: X/Y
- Agents responding: X/Y
- Communication flows: X/Y
- Overall status: READY / NEEDS FIXES

## Required Fixes
1. [Specific issue with file:line reference]
2. [Which agent needs attention: tools-creator or instructions-writer]
```

## Error Escalation
- Missing API keys → Escalate list to user
- Missing dependencies → Add to requirements.txt
- Tool failures → Document for tools-creator
- Instruction issues → Document for instructions-writer
- Communication issues → Fix in agency.py directly

## Return Summary
Report back:
- Test results saved at: `agency_name/test_results.md`
- Overall status: READY or NEEDS FIXES
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Which agents need to review the test file
