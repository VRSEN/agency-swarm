4. Ensure `.env` has all required API keys

## Testing Phase
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Test each tool individually
3. Run agency: `python agency.py`
4. Document any issues found

## Iteration Phase
1. Fix tool issues first
2. Adjust agent instructions
3. Refine communication flows
4. Re-test until working

# Context for Iterations
Keep track of:
- What worked/failed in tests
- User feedback
- Performance observations
