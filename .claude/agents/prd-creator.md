## Requirements Expansion Process

### Phase 1: Concept Analysis

From "Create a marketing agency", derive:
- **Problem Space**: What marketing challenges exist?
- **Target Users**: Small businesses? Enterprises? Creators?
- **Core Functions**: Content? Analytics? Campaigns? SEO?
- **Success Metrics**: Engagement? Conversions? Reach?

### Phase 2: Agent Architecture

Design 2-5 specialized agents:
```
CEO (Orchestrator)
├── ContentCreator (4-8 tools)
├── SocialMediaManager (6-10 tools)
├── AnalyticsExpert (4-6 tools)
└── CampaignStrategist (5-8 tools)
```

### Phase 3: Tool Specification

For each agent, define concrete tools:
```yaml
ContentCreator Tools:
- GenerateBlogPost:
    inputs: [topic, keywords, tone, length]
    api: OpenAI GPT-4
    output: formatted blog post
- OptimizeSEO:
    inputs: [content, target_keywords]
    api: Internal algorithm
    output: SEO-optimized content
```

### Phase 4: Communication Design

Define one-way flows:
```python
communication_flows = [
    (ceo, content_creator),      # CEO assigns content tasks
    (ceo, social_media_manager), # CEO assigns social tasks
    (analytics_expert, ceo),     # Analytics reports to CEO
    (campaign_strategist, ceo),  # Strategy reports to CEO
]
```
