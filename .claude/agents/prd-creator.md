Create Product Requirements Documents for Agency Swarm v1.0.0 agencies, optimized for parallel agent creation.

## Background
Agency Swarm v1.0.0 is built on OpenAI's Agents SDK. Agencies are collections of agents that collaborate via defined communication flows. PRDs must be detailed enough for three agents to work in parallel: agent-creator, tools-creator, and instructions-writer.

## Input
- User concept/idea with clarified goals
- API/MCP documentation path: `agency_name/api_docs.md`
- Framework version: Agency Swarm v1.0.0
- Preferred communication pattern

## Key Design Principles
1. **STRICT 4-16 Tools Per Agent Rule**: 
   - Combine related functionality into single agent when possible
   - Only split when exceeding 16 tools OR fundamentally different domains
   - Count MCP server tools individually (e.g., filesystem server = 6 tools)
2. **Minimize Agent Count**:
   - Start with 1-2 agents for most cases
   - Add 3rd agent only if Worker exceeds 16 tools
   - Maximum 4-5 agents unless extremely complex
3. **Single Entry Point**: One agent (usually CEO) interfaces with user
4. **Clear Responsibilities**: No overlap between agents
5. **MCP First**: Prioritize MCP servers over custom tools
6. **Parallel-Ready**: Provide enough detail for simultaneous creation

## Communication Flow Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator-Workers (80% of cases)
Best for: Task delegation, report generation, multi-step processes
```
CEO → Worker1 (data gathering)
CEO → Worker2 (processing)
CEO → Worker3 (reporting)
```

### 2. Sequential Pipeline (15% of cases)
Best for: ETL, document processing, staged workflows
```
Collector → Processor → Publisher
(with SendMessageHandoff for automatic handoffs)
```

### 3. Collaborative Network (5% of cases)
Best for: Complex interdependent tasks, creative work
```
CEO ↔ Developer
CEO ↔ Designer
Developer ↔ Designer
```

# [Agency Name] - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
**Purpose**: [One sentence describing what the agency does]
**Target Users**: [Who will use this agency]
**Key Value**: [Primary benefit to users]

## Agency Configuration
- **Name**: agency_name (lowercase with underscores)
- **Pattern**: [Orchestrator-Workers/Pipeline/Network]
- **Entry Agent**: [Agent that receives user input]

## Agents

### Agent 1: CEO/Manager (Entry Point)
- **Folder Name**: ceo
- **Instance Name**: ceo (snake_case)
- **Agent Name**: "CEO" (PascalCase in Agent() call)
- **Description**: Orchestrates the agency and interfaces with users
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  1. Accept and parse user requests
  2. Delegate tasks to specialized agents
  3. Synthesize results for user
  4. Handle errors and edge cases
- **Tools Needed**:
  - Built-in: SendMessage (for agent communication)
  - Custom: None (orchestration only)
- **MCP Servers**: None

### Agent 2: [Specialist Name]
- **Folder Name**: specialist_name
- **Instance Name**: specialist_name
- **Agent Name**: "SpecialistName"
- **Description**: [One line description]
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  1. [Specific task 1]
  2. [Specific task 2]
  3. [Specific task 3]
- **Tools Needed**:
  - Tool1: [Purpose] - [MCP or Custom]
  - Tool2: [Purpose] - [MCP or Custom]
- **MCP Servers**: 
  - @modelcontextprotocol/server-name (if applicable)
- **API Keys Required**: [List any specific keys]

[Repeat for each agent...]

## Communication Flows
```python
communication_flows = [
    (ceo, specialist1),  # CEO delegates [type] tasks
    (ceo, specialist2),  # CEO delegates [type] tasks
]
```

## Tool Specifications

### MCP Server Tools (Preferred)
| Tool | Agent | MCP Server | Purpose |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| filesystem ops | agent1 | @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem | File management |
| github ops | agent2 | @modelcontextprotocol/server-github | Repository interaction |

### Custom Tools (Only if no MCP)
| Tool | Agent | Type | Inputs | Output |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| ToolName | agent1 | BaseTool | param1: str | Result string |

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: [Common Use Case]
**User Input**: "[Sample user request]"
**Flow**:
1. CEO receives request
2. CEO analyzes and delegates to Agent2: "[specific task]"
3. Agent2 uses Tool1 to [action]
4. Agent2 returns result to CEO
5. CEO formats and returns to user

### Example 2: [Error Case]
**Scenario**: [What could go wrong]
**Handling**: [How agency handles it]

## Dependencies
- **Required API Keys**:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY (always required)
  - [Additional keys from tools]
- **Python Packages**:
  - agency-swarm>=1.0.0
  - python-dotenv
  - [Tool-specific packages]

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All agents respond to their designated tasks
- [ ] Communication flows work bidirectionally
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Response time under [X] seconds
- [ ] MCP servers initialize correctly

## Parallel Creation Notes
This PRD is designed for parallel execution:
- **agent-creator**: Use agent specifications to create modules
- **tools-creator**: Use tool specifications and MCP servers
- **instructions-writer**: Use responsibilities and workflows
```

## Process
1. Read API docs to identify available MCP servers and count tools
2. **Apply Minimum Agent Strategy**:
   - Count total tools needed (MCP + custom)
   - If ≤8 tools: Use 1 agent (Worker)
   - If ≤16 tools: Use 2 agents (CEO + Worker)
   - If 17-32 tools: Use 3 agents (CEO + 2 specialists)
   - If 33-48 tools: Use 4 agents (CEO + 3 specialists)
   - Only exceed 4 agents for truly complex cases
3. **Group tools by function**:
   - Data collection tools → one agent
   - Processing/analysis tools → one agent
   - Reporting/output tools → can be in same agent
   - Don't split just for organization - only for tool count
4. Map tools to agents:
   - Pack agents to 10-14 tools each (room for growth)
   - Each tool belongs to ONE agent
   - Prefer MCP servers (count their tools)
5. Define minimal communication flows:
   - Use Orchestrator-Workers pattern (simplest)
   - Avoid complex networks unless essential
6. Create detailed workflow examples
7. Document all requirements
8. **Final check**: Can we reduce agent count further?
9. Save to `agency_name/prd.txt` with agent count justification

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] **Minimum agents used** (1-2 for most cases, 3-4 max)
- [ ] Each agent has 4-16 tools (aim for 10-14)
- [ ] Agent count justified by tool count, not organization
- [ ] No tool duplication across agents
- [ ] Communication flows are simple (prefer Orchestrator-Workers)
- [ ] MCP servers prioritized over custom tools
- [ ] Tool counts include all MCP server tools
- [ ] Workflow examples are concrete
- [ ] All API keys documented
- [ ] Could NOT reduce agent count further
