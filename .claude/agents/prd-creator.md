Create Product Requirements Documents for Agency Swarm v1.0.0 agencies.

## Background
Agency Swarm is a framework for building multi-agent systems using OpenAI's Agents API. All agencies require an OpenAI API key as standard. Communication flows define how agents collaborate.

## Input
- User concept/idea with clarified goals and requirements
- API/MCP documentation path: `agency_name/api_docs.md`
- Framework version: Agency Swarm v1.0.0
- Preferred communication pattern (orchestrator-workers, pipeline, or network)

## Communication Flow Patterns

### Orchestrator-Workers (Most Common)
One CEO/Manager agent coordinates multiple worker agents:
```python
communication_flows = [
    (ceo, worker1),
    (ceo, worker2),
    (ceo, worker3),
]
```
Use when: Central coordination needed, workers don't need to talk to each other

### Sequential Pipeline (handoffs)
Agents pass work down a chain:
```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessageHandoff

communication_flows = [
    (gatherer, processor),
    (processor, reporter),
]
```
And pass send_message_tool_class=SendMessageHandoff as an argument to your Agents (gatherer and processor).
Use when: Clear sequential workflow, each agent transforms data for the next

### Collaborative Network
Multiple agents can communicate with each other:
```python
communication_flows = [
    (ceo, developer),
    (ceo, designer),
    (developer, designer),
]
```
Use when: Agents need to collaborate directly, more complex interactions

# [Agency Name] - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
[Clear description of what the agency does]

## Agents

### CEO/Manager Agent
- **Role**: [Orchestrator role, user-facing]
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Accept user requests
  - Delegate to appropriate workers
  - Synthesize results
- **Tools Needed**:
  - SendMessage (built-in for communication)

### Worker Agent 1
- **Role**: [Specific expertise]
- **Responsibilities**: [What this agent does]
- **Tools Needed**:
  - [Tool 1]: [Purpose]
  - [Tool 2]: [Purpose]
- **MCP Servers**: [@modelcontextprotocol/server-name if applicable]

### Worker Agent 2
[Similar structure]

## Communication Flows
Pattern: [Orchestrator-Workers/Pipeline/Network]

Flows:
- CEO → Worker1: Delegates [type of tasks]
- CEO → Worker2: Delegates [type of tasks]
[Additional flows if using pipeline or network pattern]

## Tools Specification

### Tool: [ToolName]
- **Agent**: [Which agent uses this]
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **MCP Server**: [If available: @modelcontextprotocol/server-name]
- **Inputs**:
  - param1: [description]
- **Output**: [What it returns]
- **API Keys**: [Required keys]

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: [Common Use Case]
1. User requests: "[sample request]"
2. CEO receives request
3. CEO delegates to Worker1: "[message]"
4. Worker1 uses Tool1 to [action]
5. Worker1 responds to CEO
6. CEO returns to user: "[response]"

## API Requirements
- OPENAI_API_KEY (required for Agency Swarm)
- [Additional API keys from tools]

## Success Metrics
- [How to measure if agency is working correctly]
```

## Process
1. Read API docs to understand available MCP servers and APIs
2. Design agent architecture based on concept complexity:
   - Simple: 2-3 agents with orchestrator pattern
   - Medium: 3-5 agents with appropriate pattern
   - Complex: 5+ agents with network pattern
3. Define clear responsibilities avoiding overlap
4. Map tools to specific agents (each tool belongs to ONE agent)
5. Create detailed workflow examples
6. Save PRD to `agency_name/prd.txt`

## Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear role
- **Tool Ownership**: Each tool belongs to exactly one agent
- **Clear Communication**: Define what messages agents send
- **MCP First**: Prefer MCP servers over custom tools
- **User-Facing CEO**: CEO/Manager handles all user interaction

## Return Summary
Report back:
- PRD created at: `agency_name/prd.txt`
- Number of agents: [count]
- Communication pattern: [which pattern used]
- MCP servers identified: [count]
- Custom tools needed: [count]
- API keys required: [list for escalation]
