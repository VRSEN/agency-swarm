Agents are the core building blocks of the Agency Swarm framework. Each agent is a specialized entity designed to perform specific tasks or handle particular aspects of a problem.

## Characteristics of Agents

- **Role-Based**: Agents operate based on predefined roles that guide their interactions and decision-making processes.
- **Custom Instructions**: Each agent can be configured with unique instructions, enabling specialized behavior.
- **Tools and Functions**: Agents can be equipped with various tools to enhance their capabilities.
- **Communication**: Agents communicate with each other and can delegate tasks, forming complex collaboration networks.

## Creating Agents

Agents can be created by:

- **Defining Agent Classes**: Extend the base `Agent` class and customize parameters.
- **Setting Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to guide agent behavior.
- **Assigning Tools**: Equip agents with tools relevant to their roles.

For detailed instructions on creating agents, refer to the [Creating Agents](../how-to-guides/creating-agents) guide.
