An agency is a collection of agents working collaboratively. Setting up an agency involves defining agents and their communication flows.

## Steps to Create an Agency

1. **Import Agents and Agency Class**:
   ```python
   from agency_swarm import Agency
   from CEO import CEO
   from Developer import Developer
   from VirtualAssistant import VirtualAssistant
   ```

2. **Instantiate Agents**:
   ```python
   ceo = CEO()
   dev = Developer()
   va = VirtualAssistant()
   ```

3. **Define the Agency**:
   ```python
   agency = Agency([
       ceo,
       [ceo, dev],
       [ceo, va],
       [dev, va]
   ],
      shared_instructions='agency_manifesto.md',
       temperature=0.5,
       max_prompt_tokens=25000
   )
   ```

4. **Run the Agency**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       agency.run_demo()
   ```

## Shared Instructions

- **Agency Manifesto**: A `agency_manifesto.md` file containing shared instructions and guidelines.
- **Purpose**: Aligns all agents with common goals and operating principles.
