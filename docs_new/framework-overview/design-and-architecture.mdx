# Design and Architecture

Agency Swarm employs a modular architecture that allows for flexible configuration of AI agents. The framework connects assistants with a `SendMessage` tool, enabling them to call other agents as tools. This design facilitates a collaborative environment where agents can communicate and coordinate to solve complex tasks.

Agents within Agency Swarm are designed to communicate and collaborate, enabling the creation of complex, multi-agent systems that can solve sophisticated problems by working together.
