Communication flows in Agency Swarm are flexible and user-defined. Unlike other frameworks, they are **not strictly hierarchical** or **sequential**. Communication permissions are established from left to right inside the `agency_chart`.

For example:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
agency = Agency([
    ceo,       # CEO is the entry point for user communication
    [ceo, dev],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
    [ceo, va],   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
    [dev, va]    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
])
```

In this setup:

- The **CEO** can initiate conversations and assign tasks to the **Developer** and **Virtual Assistant**.
- The **Developer** cannot initiate a conversation with the **CEO**, but can communicate with the **Virtual Assistant**.
- Agents added at the top level (e.g., `ceo`) can interact directly with the user.
