## Production-Readiness

- **Robust Error Handling**: Designed for real-world applications with robust error handling, asynchronous execution, and advanced monitoring.
- **Seamless Integration**: Streamlined setup processes allow seamless integration with various AI models, from proprietary to open-source.

## Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems

- **Hierarchical Structures**: Supervisor agents can delegate tasks to subordinate agents, enabling complex task orchestration.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Agents can decide which other agent is best suited for a particular subtask, facilitating flexible collaboration.
