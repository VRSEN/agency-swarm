<Tip>
Asynchronous execution allows agents and tools to operate concurrently, improving overall efficiency.
</Tip>

## Enabling Asynchronous Agents

To enable asynchronous execution for agents, set the `async_mode` parameter to `"threading"` when initializing the agency.

<CodeBlock title="Initialize Agency with Asynchronous Agents">
```python
agency = Agency(agents=[ceo], async_mode='threading')
```
</CodeBlock>

**Benefits**:

- Agents operate independently without waiting for others to complete tasks.
- Improved performance in multi-agent setups.

## Enabling Asynchronous Tools

To enable asynchronous execution for tools, set the `async_mode` parameter to `"tools_threading"`.

<CodeBlock title="Initialize Agency with Asynchronous Tools">
```python
agency = Agency(agents=[ceo], async_mode='tools_threading')
```
</CodeBlock>

**Benefits**:

- Tools execute concurrently, reducing latency for I/O-bound operations.
- Enhanced responsiveness of agents utilizing tools.

## Considerations

<Warning>
When using asynchronous execution, be mindful of concurrency issues.
</Warning>

- **Concurrency Control**: Ensure thread-safe operations to prevent race conditions. Use thread locks or other synchronization mechanisms if necessary.

- **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources to avoid overconsumption due to multiple threads. Keep an eye on CPU and memory usage.
