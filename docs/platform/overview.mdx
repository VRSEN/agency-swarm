## Overview

Agencii platform is a product built on top of our framework, which allows you to focus on what actually matters most - **building your AI agents, rather than deploying them**.

It significantly simplifies the **deployment**, **management**, and **integration** of your agents, eliminating technical barriers and unnecessary complexity.

## Free Community

Additionally, we offer a completely [**free Skool community**](https://www.skool.com/agency-ai/about) with these exclusive resources to help you get started:

- 📚 AI Agent Developer Course & Playbooks
- 💬 Weekly Q&A Calls
- 👨‍💻 Professional Developer Support
- 📄 Templates and Agents
- 🤝 Project Collaboration

## Future Roadmap

We plan to build the first true AI agent builder platform that will allow you to build and customize AI agents for any use case.

Notable features include:

- [x] **Agent Hosting & Runtime:** Deploy agents built with the framework directly from GitHub in a few clicks.
- [x] **Vertical Agent Marketplace:** Share and import community-built agents directly within the platform.
- [ ] **Agent Builder:** Lovable-type UI to build AI agents directly within the platform.
- [ ] **Agent Swarm**: A unified UI with super agents that complete most general tasks like coding, presentations, docs, sheets, etc and build other agents for tasks it can't do yet.
- [ ] **Background Agents:** Agents can schedule themselves or by the user to execute tasks autonomously in the background.
- [ ] **Workspaces:** Role-based access controls and shared workspaces for seamless collaboration with your clients.
- [ ] **Workflows:** Build agentic AI workflows to automate more rigid repetitive business processes.
- [ ] **Analytics:** Comprehensive analytics and reporting with a focus on cost and outcomes. (ROI)
- [ ] **Enterprise Security & Compliance:** SOC2 compliance, single sign-on (SSO), advanced encryption, and audit capabilities.
