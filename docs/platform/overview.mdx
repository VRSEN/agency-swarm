## Overview

Agencii platform is a product built on top of our framework, which allows you to focus on what actually matters most - **building your AI agents, rather than deploying them**.

It significantly simplifies the **deployment**, **management**, and **integration** of your agents, eliminating technical barriers and unnecessary complexity.

## Understanding Credits

Credits power everything on the platform. Think of them as a flexible usage allowance that scales with the work your agents do—from quick chat responses to complex multi-step automations running in sandboxes.

Instead of charging per request or per feature, we use credits to provide transparent, usage-based billing. The more complex the task, the more credits it uses. Simple interactions cost less; heavy compute and long-running agents cost more.


### What Consumes Credits

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AI Tokens** | Processing requests through LLMs, image generation, and other AI models |
| **Compute** | Running agents in your custom sandboxes and execution environments |
| **Agent Builds** | Creating, configuring, and deploying new agents |
| **File Storage** | Storing and managing files created during your tasks |
| **Web Searches** | Searching the internet for information needed to complete tasks |
| **Third-Party Services** | Accessing external APIs and integrated services that extend your agent's capabilities |

<Note>
Once a task completes, agent activity stops consuming AI Tokens while Compute tokens continue to be consumed until the sandbox is stopped by reaching the timeout.
Persistent File storage (measured per GB used) and file downloads continue to use a small number of credits even when agents are idle.
</Note>

The specific number of credits consumed depends on the complexity of the task and duration of execution.

<Note>
When you supply your own API keys, we do not deduct credits for AI tokens or other third-party services.
</Note>

### Credit Types

Credits fall into three categories. They are deducted in a specific order to maximise value:

#### Daily Credits

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Who gets them** | All users (Free and Pro) |
| **Amount** | 25 credits per day |
| **Refresh** | Every 24 hours at midnight UTC |
| **Rollover** | No — unused daily credits reset and do not accumulate |

Daily credits are use-it-or-lose-it. They refresh back to 25 every day at midnight UTC, regardless of how many you had left the previous day.

#### Monthly Credits

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Who gets them** | Pro users only |
| **Amount** | 2,000 credits per month |
| **Refresh** | At the start of each billing cycle |
| **Rollover** | No — unused monthly credits do not carry over |

Monthly credits are your subscription's main allocation and refresh when your billing cycle renews.

#### Refill Credits

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Who gets them** | Anyone who purchases them |
| **Amount** | Based on purchase |
| **Refresh** | One-time purchase |
| **Rollover** | Yes — refill credits never expire |

Refill credits are additional credits you purchase when needed.

### Credit Usage Priority

When you run a task, credits are consumed in this order:

1. Daily credits (used first)
2. Monthly credits (used second)
3. Refill credits (used last)

This ensures expiring credits are always used before your permanent refill credits.

<Note>
We prioritise expiring credits so you get maximum value from every plan. Refill credits stay available as your backup.
</Note>

## Monitoring Your Usage

Track credit consumption in **Settings → Billing** to review:

- **Current balance:** remaining daily, monthly, and refill credits
- **Usage by agency:** credit consumption per agency to highlight the most resource-intensive builds

## Credit Refunds

If a task fails because of a system error on our side, we automatically refund the credits used for that task.

<Note>
Refunds are not issued for tasks that fail due to user-provided instructions, external service issues, or reaching task limits. Provide clear, detailed instructions to minimise unnecessary usage.
</Note>

## Tips for Optimising Credit Usage

- Be specific with your requests so agents complete tasks efficiently.
- Batch similar tasks together when possible to limit repeated setup work.
- Review intermediate results on complex workflows before committing additional credits.
