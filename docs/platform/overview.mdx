## Overview

Agencii Platform is built on top of our framework, so you can focus on what matters most: **building your AI agents, not deploying them**.

It significantly simplifies the **deployment**, **management**, and **integration** of your agents, eliminating technical barriers and unnecessary complexity.

## Free Community

We also offer a [free Skool community](https://www.skool.com/agency-ai/about) with resources to help you get started:

- 📚 AI Agent Developer Course & Playbooks
- 💬 Weekly Q&A Calls
- 👨‍💻 Professional Developer Support
- 📄 Templates and Agents
- 🤝 Project Collaboration
- ✨ Feature & Playbook Requests

## Future Roadmap

We’re building an AI agent builder platform that lets you build and customize agents for any use case.

Notable features include:

- [x] **Agent Hosting & Runtime:** Deploy agents built with the framework directly from GitHub in a few clicks.
- [x] **Vertical Agent Marketplace:** Share and import community-built agents directly within the platform.
- [ ] **Agent Builder:** Lovable-type UI to build AI agents directly within the platform.
- [ ] **Agent Swarm:** A unified UI with super agents that complete general tasks (coding, presentations, docs, spreadsheets, etc) and build other agents for tasks they can’t do yet.
- [ ] **Background Agents:** Agents can be scheduled by you to execute tasks autonomously in the background.
- [ ] **Workspaces:** Role-based access controls and shared workspaces for seamless collaboration with your clients.
- [ ] **Workflows:** Build agentic AI workflows to automate more rigid repetitive business processes.
- [ ] **Analytics:** Comprehensive analytics and reporting with a focus on cost, outcomes, and ROI.
- [ ] **Enterprise Security & Compliance:** SOC2 compliance, single sign-on (SSO), advanced encryption, and audit capabilities.
