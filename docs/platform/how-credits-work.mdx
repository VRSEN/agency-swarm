## Understanding Credits

Credits are your usage balance on the platform. They power everything your agents do—from short answers to long-running, multi-step workflows in sandboxes.

Instead of charging per request or per feature, we use credits to provide transparent, usage-based billing. The more complex the task, the more credits it uses. Simple interactions cost less; heavy compute and long-running agents cost more.


### What Consumes Credits

Credit usage depends on task complexity and how long your sandbox runs.

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AI Tokens** | Processing requests through LLMs, image generation, and other AI models |
| **Compute** | Running agents in your custom sandboxes and execution environments |
| **Agent Builds** | Creating, configuring, and deploying new agents |
| **File Storage** | Storing and managing files created during your tasks |
| **Web Searches** | Searching the internet for information needed to complete tasks |
| **Third-Party Services** | Accessing external APIs and integrated services that extend your agent's capabilities |

<Note>
- After a task completes, **AI token usage stops**, but **compute** can continue until your sandbox stops (timeout).
- **Storage and downloads** can still use a small number of credits while agents are idle.
- If you use **your own API keys**, we don’t deduct credits for AI tokens or other third-party services.
</Note>

### Credit Types

Credits fall into three categories. They are deducted in a specific order to maximize value:

  <Card title="Daily Credits" icon="circle-dollar">
    Use-it-or-lose-it credits that reset to 25 every day.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monthly Credits" icon="rocket">
    Your main allocation, refreshed each billing cycle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refill Credits" icon="upload">
    Extra credits you can purchase anytime that never expire.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Credit type | Who gets them | Amount | Refresh | Rollover | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily** | All users (Free and Pro) | 25 credits per day | Every 24 hours at midnight UTC | No — unused daily credits reset and do not accumulate | Use-it-or-lose-it. Resets to 25 at midnight UTC. |
| **Monthly** | Pro users only | 2,000 credits per month | At the start of each billing cycle | No — unused monthly credits do not carry over | Main plan allocation. Refreshes each billing cycle. |
| **Refill** | Anyone who purchases them | Based on purchase | One-time purchase | Yes — refill credits never expire | One-time purchase. Never expires. |

### Credit Usage Priority

When you run a task, credits are consumed in this order:

1. **Daily credits** (used first)
2. **Monthly credits** (used second)
3. **Refill credits** (used last)

This ensures expiring credits are always used before your permanent refill credits.

<Note>
We prioritize expiring credits so you get maximum value from every plan. Refill credits stay available as your backup.
</Note>

## Monitoring Your Usage

Track credit consumption in [**Settings → Billing**](https://agencii.ai/settings/?tab=billing) to review:

- **Current balance:** remaining daily, monthly, and refill credits
- **Usage by agency:** credit consumption per agency to highlight the most resource-intensive builds

## Credit Refunds

If a task fails because of a system error on our side, we automatically refund the credits used for that task.

<Warning>
Refunds are not issued for tasks that fail due to user-provided instructions, external service issues, or reaching task limits. Provide clear, detailed instructions to minimize unnecessary usage.
</Warning>
