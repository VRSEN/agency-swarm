## Overview

Additional instructions allow you to pass additional context to the agent at the time of the request. Typically, this is used to pass session or specific user data. For example, if user is already signed in on your application, and you know their email, there is no reason for the agent to as it again. So, you can simply add in additional instructions: "The current user's email is [myemail@example.com](mailto:myemail@example.com) please use this to submit all customer support tickets"

## Usage

### Widgets

To use **additional instructions** in widgets, simply add them in the **third parameter** in the ChatComponent ****`init()` function like below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Travel Planner</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script
      defer
      src="https://openai-widget.web.app/ChatComponent.bundle.js"
    ></script>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        // Check if the chat container exists
        var chatContainer = document.getElementById("chat-container");
        // If the chat container doesn't exist, create it
        if (!chatContainer) {
          chatContainer = document.createElement("div");
          chatContainer.id = "chat-container";
          document.body.appendChild(chatContainer);
        }

        let additionalInstructions = "User's favorite city is Paris."

        // userId should be defined somewhere in your application
        //additionalInstructions = "The current user id is" + userId

        // Initialize the Chat component
        if (window.ChatComponent) {
          ChatComponent.init("<your-widget-id>", "#chat-container", additionalInstructions);
        } else {
          console.error("ChatComponent is not available");
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CustomGPTs

To use **additional instruction with CustomGPTs**, add a **script tag** to handle your instructions or dynamic data to the **Custom GPT**. Here's an example of how you can extend the above HTML code with a script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Travel Planner</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <iframe
      src="https://agencii.ai/custom-gpt/<your-custom-gpt-id>"
      width="800"
      height="800"
      id="custom-gpt-iframe"
      data-additional-instructions="User wants to visit Paris."
    ></iframe>
    <script>
      const iframe = document.getElementById("custom-gpt-iframe");

      window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
        if (event.data === "iframe-ready" && event.origin === "https://agencii.ai") {
          // Get additional instructions from the HTML data attribute or use your own logic to set it
          let additionalInstructions = iframe.getAttribute("data-additional-instructions") || "";

          // userEmail should be defined somewhere in your application
          // additionalInstructions += "Current user's email is " + userEmail

          // Send the additional instructions to the iframe
          iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(
            {
              type: "additionalInstructions",
              value: additionalInstructions,
            },
            "https://agencii.ai"
          );
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's an example of the **Custom GPT's** response based on this input:
