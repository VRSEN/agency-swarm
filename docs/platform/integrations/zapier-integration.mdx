## Agencii Zapier App Documentation

The Agencii Zapier app provides native features out of the box for interacting with your agents.
It currently supports the following actions:

<Card title="Prompt">
  <p>The <strong>Prompt</strong> action allows you to generate AI-driven responses using your agent. It takes a given prompt, context, or input data and returns a relevant, coherent, and contextually aware response. Ideal for automating conversations, decision-making processes, and intelligent task execution within your workflows.</p>
</Card>

<Tip>We are in constant development and will be adding more actions & triggers soon.</Tip>
