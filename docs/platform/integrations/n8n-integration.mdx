## Feature Overview

n8n is a flexible workflow automation platform that lets you connect dozens of services in visual flows. The Agencii **n8n community node** (`n8n-nodes-agencii`) connects your agents to these workflows so your agencies can receive tasks, run tools, and send back answers directly inside n8n.

## Prerequisites

- **Agencii Platform account** with at least one deployed agency and agent.
- **Platform API Key** – available under **Settings → API Keys** in the Agencii dashboard.
- **n8n instance** with permissions to install **Community Nodes**.

<Note>
Existing users currently need to use a self-hosted n8n instance to install the Agencii community node, as the `n8n-nodes-agencii` npm package is in the process of verification. For more details on how this works in n8n, see the n8n community nodes installation guide at https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/.
</Note>

## Step 1: Set up n8n Integration in Agencii

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an n8n Platform integration">
    1. In the Agencii dashboard, open **Deploy → Platforms** from the sidebar and click **New Platform**.

    2. In the **Create a New Platform** dialog, select **n8n** and click **Create Platform**.

    ![Select n8n as the platform type](/images/integrations/n8n-integration/n8n-create-a-new-platform-modal.png)

    3. On the **Configure n8n Integration** screen, choose:
       - **Agency** – the agency you want n8n to talk to.
       - **Default Agent** – the agent that will receive messages from this integration.
       - **Integration Name** – an internal name that will also help you identify the node inside n8n.
       - **Integration Description** – optional context for future reference.
    4. Click **Save and continue**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy integration data for n8n">
    After saving, you’ll see the **Copy n8n Data** screen. It includes:

    - **NPM package name**: `n8n-nodes-agencii` – used to install the node in n8n Community Nodes.
    - **Integration ID** – a unique identifier that routes messages from n8n to this specific Agencii integration.
    - **API Key hint** – your first platform API key (you can manage keys under **Settings → API Keys**).

    ![Copy n8n data showing npm package name, integration ID and API key hint](/images/integrations/n8n-integration/n8n-configure-n8n-copy-step.png)

    Keep the **Integration ID** handy—you’ll paste it into the Agencii node inside n8n.

    <Note>
    To connect Agencii with n8n, copy the NPM package name above and install it in the **Community Nodes** section of your n8n profile settings. After installation, you can use the **Agencii** node in your workflows. To understand the available actions and properties, please refer to the Agencii n8n documentation page.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install the Agencii Community Node in n8n

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the node">
    ![Install community node modal with n8n-nodes-agencii package name](/images/integrations/n8n-integration/n8n-install-community-node-modal.png)
    1. In your n8n instance, go to **Settings → Community Nodes**. You can learn more about installing and managing community nodes in the official n8n docs at https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/.
    2. Click **Install** and enter the package name:

       ```bash
       n8n-nodes-agencii
       ```

    3. Confirm the installation. After it completes, an **Agencii** node will appear in your n8n node palette.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Use the Agencii Node in a Workflow

The Agencii node exposes a single operation designed to send messages to your agency and receive structured responses.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Agencii node">
    1. Add an **Agencii** node to your workflow.
    
    ![Agencii Send message to agency node with parameters filled in](/images/integrations/n8n-integration/n8n-send-message-node-params.png)
    ![Agencii node details with available actions](/images/integrations/n8n-integration/n8n-node-details-panel.png)
    
    2. Select your **Agencii API** credentials.
    3. Under **Resource**, choose **Chat**, and under **Operation**, select **Send Message**.
    4. Configure the main fields:
       - **Integration ID** *(required)* – paste the Integration ID from your Agencii n8n Platform integration.
       - **Message** *(required)* – the prompt or instruction you want your default agent to process.
       - **Session ID** *(optional)* – reuse the `sessionId` from a previous run to continue the same conversation; leave empty to start a new session.

    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand the node output">
    The Agencii node returns a JSON payload with (among others):

    - `text` / `response` – the main answer from your agency.
    - `sessionId` – the session identifier to reuse for multi-turn conversations.
    - `n8nIntegrationId` – the platform integration that handled the request.

    You can pass these values into downstream nodes (e.g., email, CRM, webhooks) to build complete automations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Use Cases

- **Human-in-the-loop review** – send form or CRM data to your agency, then route the response into an approval step.
- **Content generation pipelines** – trigger the Agencii node from schedules or webhooks and store generated content in Google Sheets, Notion, or a database.
- **Multi-step analysis** – chain multiple Agencii nodes while reusing `sessionId` to keep context across data enrichment, analysis, and recommendation steps.
