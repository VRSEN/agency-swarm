When you list an agency on the marketplace, you can define an `OnboardingTool` so buyers can enter the details their business needs.

## Why It Matters

Two companies can need the same role but with different rules, tools, and workflows. Onboarding lets each buyer customize the agent without you rebuilding it.

## Quick Example

```python
from agency_swarm import BaseTool
from pydantic import Field

class OnboardingTool(BaseTool):
    agent_name: str = Field(..., description="Name shown to the buyer")
    business_overview: str = Field(..., description="Short business overview")

    def run(self):
        return "Saved"
```

**Rules:**
- The file must be named `onboarding_tool.py`.
- The file must live in the repo root.
- Field descriptions show up in the marketplace form.
