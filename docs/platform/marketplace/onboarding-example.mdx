Below is a complete example for an accounting agent. Use it as a reference and simplify as needed.

```python
from agency_swarm import BaseTool
from pydantic import Field
from typing import Literal
import os
import json

class OnboardingTool(BaseTool):
    agent_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of your accounting agent")
    business_overview: str = Field(..., description="Industry, size, and accounting needs")
    accounting_frequency: Literal["weekly", "monthly", "quarterly"] = Field(
        ..., description="How often accounting tasks run"
    )
    accounting_software: Literal["xero", "quickbooks", "freshbooks", "sage", "other"] = Field(
        ..., description="Accounting software"
    )
    invoice_delivery_method: Literal["email", "customer_portal", "both"] = Field(
        ..., description="How invoices are delivered"
    )

    def run(self):
        tool_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        config_path = os.path.join(tool_dir, "onboarding_config.json")
        with open(config_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            json.dump(self.model_dump(), f, indent=2)
        return f"Config created at: {config_path}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tool = OnboardingTool(
        agent_name="Acme Corp Accounting Agent",
        business_overview="Mid-size manufacturer with 50 employees",
        accounting_frequency="monthly",
        accounting_software="xero",
        invoice_delivery_method="customer_portal",
    )
    print(tool.run())
```
