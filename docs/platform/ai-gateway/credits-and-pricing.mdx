## How credits are calculated

AI Gateway charges credits based on:

- **Model pricing**
- **Input and output token counts**

Your usage is calculated from the response and deducted from your balance at cost.

<Note>
Credit deductions follow the same balance rules as the rest of the Agencii platform.
See [How Credits Work](/platform/how-credits-work) for details.
</Note>

## Low balance behavior

If your balance is too low to run a request, the gateway returns an error telling you to refill credits.

## Track your usage

Review AI Gateway usage and balance in your [Agencii dashboard billing page](https://agencii.ai/settings/?tab=billing).
