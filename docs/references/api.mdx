## Agency Class

The Agency class orchestrates a collection of Agent instances based on a defined structure (AgencyChart).

## Agent Class

The Agent class is the core component of Agency Swarm that represents an AI assistant. Each agent has specific capabilities, tools, and can process files and instructions.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

class Agent:
    def __init__(self,
                 name: str = None,
                 description: str = None,
                 instructions: str = "",
                 tools: list = None,
                 temperature: float = None,
                 model: str = "gpt-4-0125-preview",
                 files_folder: Union[List[str], str] = None):
        """
        Initialize an Agent instance.

        Parameters:
            name: The agent's name (defaults to class name if not provided)
            description: Brief description of the agent's role
            instructions: Path to markdown file containing agent instructions
            tools: List of tool classes available to the agent
            temperature: Controls randomness in responses (0-1)
            model: OpenAI model to use (defaults to GPT-4)
            files_folder: Path(s) to folder(s) containing files for the agent
        """
```

### Key Methods

def init_oai(self):
    """

## BaseTool Class

The base class for creating custom tools that agents can use. Tools allow agents to perform specific actions or access external functionality.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel

class BaseTool(BaseModel, ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all tools.
    Inherits from Pydantic BaseModel for automatic validation.
    """

    class ToolConfig:
        strict: bool = False  # Enable strict schema validation
        one_call_at_a_time: bool = False  # Prevent concurrent calls

    # Shared state and caller agent properties
    _shared_state: ClassVar[SharedState] = None  # Manages shared state between tools
    _caller_agent: Any = None  # Reference to the agent using the tool
    _event_handler: Any = None  # Handles tool events
```

### Key Methods

<CodeGroup>

```python openai_schema
@classmethod
@property
def openai_schema(cls) -> dict:
    """
    Generate OpenAI function schema from the tool class.
    Automatically extracts documentation from class and parameter docstrings.

    The schema includes:
    - Tool name and description
    - Parameter definitions with types and descriptions
    - Required parameters list
    - Strict validation settings (if enabled)

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing tool schema in OpenAI format
    """
```

```python run
@abstractmethod
def run(self, **kwargs):
    """
    Execute the tool's main functionality.
    Must be implemented by subclasses.

    Parameters:
        **kwargs: Tool-specific parameters defined in the class

    Returns:
        Tool-specific return value
    """
```

## ToolFactory Class

The ToolFactory class provides convenient methods to create tools from various sources like OpenAPI specifications, LangChain tools, or Python files. This makes it easy to integrate external APIs and existing tools into your agents.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory

class ToolFactory:
    """
    Utility class for creating tools from various sources including OpenAPI specs,
    LangChain tools, and local Python files.
    """
```

### Key Methods

<CodeGroup>

```python from_langchain_tools
@staticmethod
def from_langchain_tools(tools: List) -> List[Type[BaseTool]]:
    """
    Convert LangChain tools into Agency Swarm tools.

    Parameters:
        tools: List of LangChain tool instances or classes

    Returns:
        List of converted BaseTool classes

    Example:
        from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool
        tools = ToolFactory.from_langchain_tools([DuckDuckGoSearchTool()])
    """
```

```python from_openapi_schema
@staticmethod
def from_openapi_schema(
    schema: Union[str, dict],
    headers: Dict[str, str] = None,
    params: Dict[str, Any] = None,
    strict: bool = False
) -> List[Type[BaseTool]]:
    """

        params: Optional query parameters to include in all requests
        strict: Enable strict schema validation
