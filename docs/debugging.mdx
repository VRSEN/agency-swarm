When your agency isn't behaving as expected, follow this process.

## Step 1: Enable Verbose Output

```python
agency.terminal_demo(show_reasoning=True)
```

This shows the agent's thinking process and tool calls in real-time.

## Step 2: Inspect the Response Object

```python
import asyncio

async def debug_run():
    result = await agency.get_response("Your message")
    
    # What the user sees
    print("Final output:", result.final_output)
    
    # Items generated during this run (tool calls, messages, etc.)
    print("New items:", result.new_items)

asyncio.run(debug_run())
```

## Step 3: Check Tool Execution

If tools aren't being called:

```python
# List all tools registered to the agent
print("Tools:", [t.name for t in agent.tools])

# Run a simple test message
result = await agency.get_response("Use the search tool to find 'test'")
```

## Worked Example: Slow Agent

**Problem:** Agent takes 30+ seconds to respond.

```python
import asyncio, time

async def debug_slow():
    start = time.time()
    result = await agency.get_response("Simple question")
    print(f"Time: {time.time() - start:.1f}s")
    
    for item in result.new_items:
        print(f"- {type(item).__name__}")

asyncio.run(debug_slow())
```

**Common causes:** Too many tools, complex instructions, or slow API calls in tools.

## Add Observability

For production debugging, enable tracing:

```python
from agency_swarm import trace

async def run_agent():
    with trace("debug_run"):
        result = await agency.get_response("Your message")
        return result
```
