# Quickstart

Get up and running with Agency Swarm quickly. When getting started, you have two options:

1. **Start from Scratch**: Best for understanding the framework fundamentals and building your own agents and tools.
2. **Use Genesis Swarm**: Best for quick setup with pre-built agent templates and tools that you can fine-tune.
3. **Create agent templates with CLI**: Best for creating a structured environment for each agent and tool. See [Advanced Agents](advanced-usage/agents.md) for more information.

## Start from Scratch

1. **Set Your OpenAI Key**:
    ```python
    from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
    set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

2. **Create Tools**: Define your custom tools with [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).  
All tools must extend the `BaseTool` class and implement the `run` method. 
    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field
    
    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does. 
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
        """
    
        example_field: str = Field(
            ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
        )
    
        def run(self):
            """
            The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
            This method should utilize the fields defined above to perform the task.
            """
            # Your custom tool logic goes here
            do_something(self.example_field)
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

3. **Define Agent Roles**: Create your agents with specific roles and responsibilities.
    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent
    
    ceo = Agent(
        name="CEO",
        description="Responsible for client communication, task planning, and management.",
        instructions="path/to/instructions.md",  # can be a string or file path
        tools=[],
        temperature=0.5,
        max_prompt_tokens=25000,
    )

    developer = Agent(
        name="Developer",
        description="Responsible for executing tasks and providing feedback.",
        instructions="You must execute the tasks provided by the CEO and provide feedback.",
        tools=[MyCustomTool]
    )
    ```

4. **Create Agency**: Define your agency chart and communication flows.
    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency
    
    agency = Agency([
        ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
        [ceo, dev],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
    ], shared_instructions='You are a part of an ai development agency.\n\n')
    ```
    
    !!! note "Note on Communication Flows"
         Communication flows are directional, established from left to right in the agency_chart definition. The CEO can initiate a chat with the developer (dev) who can respond, but the developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO.

5. **Run Demo**: Choose your preferred interface:
    
    Web interface:
    ```python
    agency.demo_gradio(height=900)
    ```
    
    Terminal version:
    ```python
    agency.run_demo()
    ```
    
    Backend version:
    ```python
    completion_output = agency.get_completion("Please create a new website for our client.", yield_messages=False)
    ```

## Use Genesis Agency

1. **Run the `genesis` command**:
    ```bash
    agency-swarm genesis [--openai_key "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    ```
