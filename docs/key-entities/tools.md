# Tools

Tools are modular functions that agents can call to perform specific tasks. They extend the capabilities of agents, allowing them to interact with the environment or perform computations.

## Characteristics of Tools

- **Modular**: Tools are independent functions that can be reused across agents.
- **Typed Parameters**: Use Pydantic for clear parameter definitions and validation.
- **Response Handling**: Tools can process inputs and produce outputs that agents use in decision-making.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle exceptions and validate outputs.

## Creating Tools

Tools are created by:

- **Extending the `BaseTool` Class**: Implement the `run` method with custom logic.
- **Defining Parameters**: Specify input fields using Pydantic's `Field`.
- **Implementing Validation**: Use Pydantic validators for input/output validation.
