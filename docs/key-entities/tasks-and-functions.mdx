# Tasks and Functions

Tasks represent units of work that agents need to complete. Functions allow agents to break down complex tasks into manageable actions.

## Tasks

- **Definition**: High-level objectives that can be broken down into subtasks.
- **Delegation**: Agents can delegate tasks to other agents better suited for specific subtasks.
- **Management**: Tasks can be tracked and managed across agents within an agency.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Enable agents to perform specific actions or computations.
- **Implementation**: Defined as methods within agents or as standalone tools.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Functions can be executed asynchronously to improve efficiency.
