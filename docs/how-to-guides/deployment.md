# Deployment

Deploying your agency to a production environment involves several considerations to ensure scalability and reliability.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Dynamic Loading**: Load agents and threads dynamically based on user sessions or specific conditions.
2. **Microservices Architecture (Optional)**: Deploy each agent as a separate microservice to scale independently.
3. **Persistence**: Implement `threads_callbacks` and `settings_callbacks` to load and save agent states and conversations.
   ```python
   agency = Agency(
       agents=[ceo],
       threads_callbacks={
           'load': lambda: load_threads(chat_id),
           'save': lambda new_threads: save_threads(new_threads)
       },
       settings_callbacks={
           'load': lambda: load_settings(user_id),
           'save': lambda new_settings: save_settings(new_settings)
       }
   )   ```

4. **Asynchronous Execution**: Utilize asynchronous modes to enhance performance.
   ```python
   agency = Agency(agents=[ceo], async_mode='threading')   ```

## Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that agents do not have unintended access to sensitive data.
- **Scaling**: Plan for horizontal scaling if expecting high load.
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track performance and issues.
