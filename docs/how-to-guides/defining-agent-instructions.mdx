# Defining Agent Instructions

Agent instructions guide the behavior of agents, shaping how they interact with users and other agents. Clear instructions are vital for consistent and expected outcomes.

## Creating Instructions

- **File Format**: Instructions are typically provided in a markdown (`.md`) file.
- **Structure**:
  ```markdown
  # Agent Role

  Describe the role and responsibilities.

  # Goals

  - List primary objectives.
  - Align goals with the agency's mission.

  # Process Workflow

  1. Step-by-step process outlining agent actions.
  2. Include decision-making criteria.
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Clarity**: Be explicit about expectations and responsibilities.
- **Alignment**: Ensure instructions align with the overall agency objectives.
- **Collaboration**: Define how the agent should interact with others.
