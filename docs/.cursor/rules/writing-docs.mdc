When writing or improving documentation for agency swarm, your primary goal is to **make sure the user sees only the information he wants to see. No more, no less.**

# Agency Swarm Documentation Writing Rules

- Write documentation in an easy to understand conversational language.
- Use simple language and clear terms.
- Be brief and to the point.
- Make documentation actionable. Place code snippets at the top so users can easily copy and paste them. Provide only essential context above the code. Move any complex or detailed explanations to the end of the page.
- The more important the information is, the higher it should be on the page.
- Highlight the important parts.
- Hide complexity under tabs, dropdowns, etc.
- Split pages into sub pages if needed. Each page must be shorter than 150 lines.

# Instructions

## Before Starting

Before starting any task, you **MUST** read the following examples of good written docs files:

- [Tools](docs/core-framework/tools/overview.mdx)
- [Agents](docs/core-framework/agents/overview.mdx)
- [Agencies](docs/core-framework/agencies/overview.mdx)
- [Communication Flows](docs/core-framework/agencies/communication-flows.mdx)

Adhere closely to the writing style and structure in these examples.

## Updating Existing Pages

1. Analyze the feedback provided by the user and deteremine which specific sections you need to update.
   - If there is a lot of feedback, create a to-do list for yourself and break it down.
2. Only update the required parts, do not add anything unrequested. Perform minimal changes, keep everything unaffected by feedback as is.
3. If asked to move the page, keep consistent folder and file structure, matching the structure in the `./docs/docs.json` file.
4. Ask the user to review the changes and provide feedback.

## Writing New Pages

1. Analyze the information or the relevant code provided by the user.
   - If user has not provided enough information, as the user a set of 3-5 relevant questions about the feature.
   - For example:
     - What is the use case for this?
     - Where can I see relevant files?
     - Do you have any example code snippets?
     - Why did you create this feature in the first place?
     - What does the user have to know before they can start using it?
     - etc...
2. Create a new page reference in the `./docs/docs.json` file in the appropriate group and sub group.
   - If it's unclear where to place the page, ask the user for clarification.
   - Make sure the folder strcuture in docs folder matches the structure in the `./docs/docs.json` file.
3. Write the page content using the same path, following all the rules above.
4. Ask the user to review the page and provide feedback.
5. Implement any adjustments as needed. See "Updating Existing Pages" section below.
