<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Your OpenAI Key">
    Begin by setting your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. It will be loaded automatically on agency initialization

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project Structure">
    **Agent Folder Structure:**

    When you run the create-agent-template command, it creates the following folder structure for your agent:

    ```
    /your-agency-path/
    └── AgentName/                    # Directory for the specific agent
        ├── files/                    # Directory for files that will be uploaded to openai
        ├── schemas/                  # Directory for OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools
        ├── tools/                    # Directory for tools to be imported by default.
        ├── AgentName.py              # The main agent class file
        ├── __init__.py               # Initializes the agent folder as a Python package
        └── instructions.md or .txt   # Instruction document for the agent
    ```

    This structure ensures that each agent has its dedicated space with all necessary files to start working on its specific tasks.

    **Agency Folder Structure:**

    The full structure of the project will look like this:

    ```
    AgencyName/
    ├── AgentName/            # Agent folder created with the command above
    ├── AnotherAgent/         # Another agent folder
    ├── agency.py             # Main file where agents are imported and the agency is defined
    ├── agency_manifesto.md   # Shared instructions and guidelines for all agents
    ├── requirements.txt      # File listing all dependencies
    └── ...
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Tools">
    In 1.x versions of the framework, you have 2 ways of defining custom tools:

    By extending agency_swarm's `BaseTool` class and implementing the `run` method.

    **MyCustomTool.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field

    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does.
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
        """

        # Define the fields with descriptions using Pydantic Field
        example_field: str = Field(
            ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
        )

        # Additional Pydantic fields as required
        # ...

        def run(self):
            """
            The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
            This method should utilize the fields defined above to perform the task.
            Doc string is not required for this method and will not be used by your agent.
            """

            # Your custom tool logic goes here
            do_something(self.example_field)

            # Return the result of the tool's operation as a string
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

    Or by using openai's `@function_tool` decorator.

    **my_custom_tool.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import function_tool

    @function_tool
    def my_custom_tool(example_field: str) -> str:
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does.
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.

        Args:
            example_field: Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent.

        Returns:
            Result of the tool's operation as a string.
        """

        # Your custom tool logic goes here
        do_something(example_field)

        # Return the result of the tool's operation as a string
        return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Agent Roles">
    Adjust the parameters and instructions for each agent.

    **Developer.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent, ModelSettings
    from .tools.my_custom_tool import my_custom_tool

    class Developer(Agent):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(
                name="Developer",
                description="Responsible for executing tasks.",
                instructions="./instructions.md",
                tools=[my_custom_tool, MyCustomTool],  # Import tools directly
                model_settings=ModelSettings(
                    temperature=0.3,
                    max_completion_tokens=25000,
                    model="gpt-4o"
                )
            )
    ```

    Tools are imported directly into the agent instead of from a folder.

    **instructions.md:**

    ```md
    You are a Developer agent responsible for executing tasks.

    # Role
    You are responsible for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

    # Process
    1. How to handle incoming requests
    2. When and how to use available tools
    3. How to collaborate with other agents
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Agency">
    Import your agents and initialize the Agency class.

    **agency.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency
    from .Developer import Developer
    from .CEO import CEO

    developer = Developer()
    ceo = CEO()

    agency = Agency(
        ceo,  # Entry point agent as positional argument
        communication_flows=[
            (ceo, developer),  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
        ],
        shared_instructions='./agency_manifesto.md'  # shared instructions for all agents
    )
    ```

    The first positional argument is the entry point agent that users interact with directly. Communication flows are defined separately.

    <Note title="Note on Communication Flows">
      In Agency Swarm, communication flows are directional tuples. For instance, in the example above: `(ceo, developer)`, the CEO can initiate a chat with the Developer, and the Developer can respond in this chat. However, the Developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Demo">

    There are multiple ways to run the demo. Add one of the following to your `agency.py` file:

    **Web Interface:**

    ```python
    agency.copilot_demo()
    ```

    <Warning>
    Copilot demo is currently minimal and will be updated in future patches
    </Warning>

    **Terminal Version:**

    ```python
    agency.terminal_demo()
    ```

    **Backend Version (Sync):**

    ```python
    result = agency.get_response_sync("Please create a new website for our client.")
    ```

    **Backend Version (Async):**

    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        result = await agency.get_response("Please create a new website for our client.")
        print(result.final_output)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab title="v0.x">

<Info>
v0.x is the **previous production version**. Install with: `pip install "agency-swarm<1.0.0"`
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Your OpenAI Key">
    Begin by setting your OpenAI API key.

    ```python
    from agency import set_openai_key
    set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the API key in the `.env` file.

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project Structure">
    Use the `create-agent-template` command to create the recommended directory structure for each agent.

    **Command Syntax:**

    ```bash
    agency-swarm create-agent-template --name "AgentName" --description "Agent Description" [--path "/path/to/directory"] [--use_txt]
    ```

    **Agent Folder Structure:**

    When you run the create-agent-template command, it creates the following folder structure for your agent:

    ```
    /your-agency-path/
    └── AgentName/                    # Directory for the specific agent
        ├── files/                    # Directory for files that will be uploaded to openai
        ├── schemas/                  # Directory for OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools
        ├── tools/                    # Directory for tools to be imported by default.
        ├── AgentName.py              # The main agent class file
        ├── __init__.py               # Initializes the agent folder as a Python package
        └── instructions.md or .txt   # Instruction document for the agent
    ```

    This structure ensures that each agent has its dedicated space with all necessary files to start working on its specific tasks.

    **Agency Folder Structure:**

    The full structure of the project will look like this:

    ```
    AgencyName/
    ├── AgentName/            # Agent folder created with the command above
    ├── AnotherAgent/         # Another agent folder
    ├── agency.py             # Main file where agents are imported and the agency is defined
    ├── agency_manifesto.md   # Shared instructions and guidelines for all agents
    ├── requirements.txt      # File listing all dependencies
    └── ...
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Tools">
    Define your custom tools by extending the `BaseTool` class and implementing the `run` method.

    **MyCustomTool.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
    from pydantic import Field

    class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
        """
        A brief description of what the custom tool does.
        The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
        It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
        """

        # Define the fields with descriptions using Pydantic Field
        example_field: str = Field(
            ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
        )

        # Additional Pydantic fields as required
        # ...

        def run(self):
            """
            The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
            This method should utilize the fields defined above to perform the task.
            Doc string is not required for this method and will not be used by your agent.
            """

            # Your custom tool logic goes here
            do_something(self.example_field)

            # Return the result of the tool's operation as a string
            return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Agent Roles">
    Adjust the parameters and instructions for each agent.

    **Developer.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent

    class Developer(Agent):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(
                name="Developer",
                description="Responsible for executing tasks.",
                instructions="./instructions.md",
                files_folder="./files",
                schemas_folder="./schemas",
                tools_folder="./tools",
                temperature=0.3,
                max_prompt_tokens=25000,
                examples=[]
            )
    ```

    Tools will be imported automatically from the `tools` folder.

    **instructions.md:**

    ```md
    You are a Developer agent responsible for executing tasks.

    # Role
    You are responsible for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

    # Process
    1. How to handle incoming requests
    2. When and how to use available tools
    3. How to collaborate with other agents
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Agency">
    Import your agents and initialize the Agency class.

    **agency.py:**

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agency
    from .Developer import Developer
    from .CEO import CEO

    developer = Developer()
    ceo = CEO()

    agency = Agency(
        [
            ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
            [ceo, developer],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
        ],
        shared_instructions='./agency_manifesto.md'  # shared instructions for all agents
    )
    ```

    Any agents that are listed in the same list (e.g., `[[ceo, developer]]`) can communicate with each other. The top-level list (`[ceo]`) defines agents that can communicate with the user.

    <Note title="Note on Communication Flows">
      In Agency Swarm, communication flows are directional, meaning they are established from left to right in the `agency_chart` definition. For instance, in the example above, the CEO can initiate a chat with the Developer (`developer`), and the Developer can respond in this chat. However, the Developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Demo">

    There are three ways to run the demo. Add one of the following lines to your `agency.py` file:

    **Web Interface:**

    ```python
    agency.demo_gradio(height=900)
    ```

    **Terminal Version:**

    ```python
    agency.run_demo()
    ```

    **Backend Version:**

    ```python
    completion_output = agency.get_completion("Please create a new website for our client.", yield_messages=False)
    ```
