Genesis Agency is a special Agency within the framework that helps you to create your own AI Agencies faster. This agency consists of specialized agents that work together to:

- Generate agent templates with appropriate folder structure
- Create custom tools and connect APIs for each agent
- Define your agency's manifesto and communication flows

<Note>
  **Genesis Agency is not perfect yet.**

  Please note that the Genesis Agency will not be able to generate complex agencies. For more complex use cases, we recommend using [Cursor](./cursor-ide).
</Note>

## Use Genesis Agency

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the `genesis` command">
    Initialize the Genesis Agency in your terminal and generate your agent templates.

    **Command Syntax:**

    ```bash
    agency-swarm genesis [--openai_key "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Chat with Genesis CEO">
    Provide comprehensive context to the Genesis Agency by including:
    - **Your agency's mission and goals.**
    - **The agents you wish to involve and their communication flows.**
    - **Tools or APIs each agent should have access to, if any.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Genesis to create your agents">
    After executing the `genesis` command, specialized agents such as `GenesisCEO` and `ToolCreator` will begin constructing your agency's structure and developing the required tools.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fine-Tune Your Agents and Tools">
    Once Genesis has created your agents, you'll find all the agent folders in the directory where you ran the `genesis` command. Fine-tune the agents and tools as needed by following these steps:

    1. **Adjust Tools**: Modify the tools in each agent's `tools` directory to meet your requirements.
    2. **Adjust Instructions**: Update the agents and their instructions in each agent's folder.
    3. **Run Agency**: Execute the `agency.py` file, send your tasks, and monitor performance.
    4. **Repeat**: Continue refining until your agents perform consistently.

    <Note>
      **Agent Development is an Iterative Process**

      Currently, agent development requires ongoing monitoring and adjustments to ensure desired performance. As larger and more advanced models become available, this process will become more streamlined.
