This is the official template for building and deploying on [Agencii (agency.ai)](https://agencii.ai/signup/).

Use it to create your own repository with the correct project structure, preconfigured AI rules, and deployment-ready defaults.

<Info>
The template includes AI rule files (for example, Cursor rules and agent workflow rules). These rules help AI coding agents generate framework-aligned agents and tools instead of generic scaffolding.
