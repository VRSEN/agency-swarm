## Detailed Comparison

Here's how Agency Swarm compares to 2 other most popular multi-agent frameworks.

| **Criteria**                       | **Agency Swarm**                                                                                                                                            | **AutoGen**                                                                                                             | **CrewAI**                                                                                                                  |

| **Origins** üèÅ                     | ‚úÖ Originated from a real AI agency building AI agents for clients worldwide.                                                                                | ‚úÖ Originated as a research experiment.                                                                                  | ‚ùå Originated as a funding vehicle, rather than a real production framework.                                                     |
| **Design & Architecture** üèóÔ∏è      | ‚úÖ Super lightweight framework with minimal abstractions. Built on top of the OpenAI Assistants and Responses API.                                                         | ‚úÖ Event-driven architecture with support for both ChatCompletions, Assistants and Responses API.                                   | ‚ùå Lacks a clear architectural design. Built on top of LangChain with numerous unnecessary abstractions.                    |
| **Reliability** üîç                 | ‚úÖ Robust type checking and validation for all tools with Pydantic.                                                                                           | ‚ùå Type hints but no validation.                                                                                         | ‚ùå Some validation is possible when using BaseTool, although the interface is not convenient to use.                         |
| **Flexibility** üîÑ                 | ‚úÖ No predefined prompts. Uniform communication.                                                                                                             | ‚ùå Contains predefined prompts. Limited, but customizable communication flows.                                           | ‚ùå Numerous predefined prompts. Only two ways of communication.                                                             |
| **Scalability** üìà                | ‚úÖ Easily scalable. Adding another agent only requires placing it in the agency chart.                                                                        | ‚ùå Although it's simple to add an agent into teams, it's almost impossible to define custom communication between them. | ‚ùå Although it's easy to add agents into crews, it's not possible to create custom communication between them.               |
| **Deployability** üöÄ               | ‚úÖ Easily deployable with special callback functions. Offers open-source templates and tutorials.                                                            | ‚úÖ Deployment with AutoGen studio.                                                                                       | ‚ùå Deployment via enterprise platform. No open-source deployment guides.                                                    |
| **Open Source Model Support** üåê   | ‚ö†Ô∏è [Limited support](/additional-features/open-source-models) with Astra Assistants API.                                                                                                                | ‚úÖ Moderate open-source model support.                                                                                   | ‚úÖ Full open-source model support.                                                                                           |
