## Detailed Comparison

Here's how Agency Swarm compares to 2 other most popular multi-agent frameworks.

| **Criteria**                       | **Agency Swarm**                                                                                                                                            | **AutoGen**                                                                                                             | **CrewAI**                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origins** 🏁                     | ✅ Originated from a real AI agency building AI agents for clients worldwide.                                                                                | ✅ Originated as a research experiment.                                                                                  | ❌ Originated as a funding vehicle, rather than a real production framework.                                                     |
| **Design & Architecture** 🏗️      | ✅ Super lightweight framework with minimal abstractions. Built on top of the OpenAI Assistants API.                                                         | ✅ Event-driven architecture with support for both ChatCompletions and Assistants API.                                   | ❌ Lacks a clear architectural design. Built on top of LangChain with numerous unnecessary abstractions.                    |
| **Reliability** 🔍                 | ✅ Robust type checking and validation for all tools with Pydantic.                                                                                           | ❌ Type hints but no validation.                                                                                         | ❌ Some validation is possible when using BaseTool, although the interface is not convenient to use.                         |
| **Flexibility** 🔄                 | ✅ No predefined prompts. Uniform communication.                                                                                                             | ❌ Contains predefined prompts. Limited, but customizable communication flows.                                           | ❌ Numerous predefined prompts. Only two ways of communication.                                                             |
| **Scalability** 📈                | ✅ Easily scalable. Adding another agent only requires placing it in the agency chart.                                                                        | ❌ Although it's simple to add an agent into teams, it's almost impossible to define custom communication between them. | ❌ Although it's easy to add agents into crews, it's not possible to create custom communication between them.               |
| **Deployability** 🚀               | ✅ Easily deployable with special callback functions. Offers open-source templates and tutorials.                                                            | ✅ Deployment with AutoGen studio.                                                                                       | ❌ Deployment via enterprise platform. No open-source deployment guides.                                                    |
| **Open Source Model Support** 🌐   | ⚠️ [Limited support](/additional-features/open-source-models) with Astra Assistants API.                                                                                                                | ✅ Moderate open-source model support.                                                                                   | ✅ Full open-source model support.                                                                                           |
