## Detailed Comparison

Here's how Agency Swarm compares to 2 other most popular multi-agent frameworks.

| **Criteria**                       | **Agency Swarm**                                                                                                                                                            | **AutoGen**                                                                                                             | **CrewAI**                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origins**                        | ✅ Originated from a real AI agency building AI agents for clients worldwide.                                                                                              | ✅ Originated as a research experiment.                                                                                 | ❌ Originated as a funding vehicle, rather than a real production framework.                                               |
| **Design & Architecture**          | ✅ Super lightweight framework with minimal abstractions. Built on top of the OpenAI Assistants and Responses API.                                                         | ✅ Event-driven architecture with support for both ChatCompletions, Assistants and Responses API.                       | ❌ Lacks a clear architectural design. Built on top of LangChain with numerous unnecessary abstractions.                   |
| **Reliability**                    | ✅ Robust type checking and validation for all tools with Pydantic. Input and output validation with agent's [guardrails system](/additional-features/output-validation)   | ❌ Type hints but no validation.                                                                                        | ❌ Some validation is possible when using BaseTool, although the interface is not convenient to use.                       |
| **Flexibility**                    | ✅ No predefined prompts. Uniform communication.                                                                                                                           | ✅ Contains overridable predefined prompts. Customizable communication via GroupChat (model/custom speaker selection).  | ❌ Numerous predefined prompts. Flows add conditional routing; customization remains limited.                              |
| **Scalability**                    | ✅ Easily scalable. Adding another agent only requires passing it to the Agency class.                                                                                     | ⚠️  Simple to add agents; complex graphs need custom orchestration.                                                     | ⚠️ Easy to add agents; Flows enable conditional orchestration, but customization is limited.                               |
| **Deployability**                  | ✅ Easily deployable with special [callback functions](/additional-features/deployment-to-production). Offers open-source templates and tutorials.                         | ⚠️ Studio for build/debug; production requires self-hosted SDK deployment.                                              | ❌ Deployment via enterprise platform. No open-source deployment guides.                                                   |
| **Open Source Model Support**      | ✅ Supports over a dozen models through [LiteLLM SDK](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs).                                                                                       | ✅ Moderate open-source model support.                                                                                  | ✅ Full open-source model support.                                                                                         |
