## Supported Observability Platforms

Agency Swarm supports three main observability approaches:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="OpenAI Tracing" icon="chart-line" href="#openai-tracing">
    Built-in tracing using OpenAI's native tools
  </Card>

## Getting Started

Let's walk through setting up each tracing solution. You can use them individually or combine them for comprehensive monitoring.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI Tracing">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Basic Setup">
        OpenAI tracing is built into Agency Swarm and requires no additional packages.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Implementation">
        ```python
        from agents import trace

        async def openai_tracing(input_message: str) -> str:
            agency_instance = create_agency()
            with trace("OpenAI tracing"):
                response = await agency_instance.get_response(message=input_message)
            return response.final_output

## Implementation Example

For a complete working example that demonstrates all three tracing methods with a multi-agent agency, see [observability_demo.py](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/examples/observability_demo.py) in the examples directory.

The example shows:
- How to set up a basic agency with CEO, Developer, and Data Analyst roles
- Implementation of all three tracing methods (OpenAI, Langfuse, AgentOps)
- A sample tool for data analysis
- Error handling and proper tracing setup

You can run the example with:
```bash
python examples/observability_demo.py
```

For more information about each platform's capabilities and configuration options, refer to their respective documentation:
- [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)
- [Langfuse Documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs)
- [AgentOps Documentation](https://docs.agentops.ai)

<Tab title="v0.x">

<Info>
v0.x is the **previous production version**. Install with: `pip install "agency-swarm<1.0.0"`
</Info>

Agency Swarm uses Langchain callbacks to connect with third party observability tools.

<Info>
  Although we strongly discourage using Langchain for agent development due to its numerous unnecessary abstractions, it currently has the widest support among third-party observability tools. For this reason, we have adopted its callback structure. However, no Langchain code is used within Agency Swarm.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Prerequisites" defaultOpen={true}>
  To get started with observability features, install the Langchain package:

  ```bash
  pip install langchain
  ```
</Accordion>

## Supported Observability Platforms

When it comes to choosing your observability platform, there are a few options. You can use one or multiple trackers simultaneously for comprehensive monitoring:

  <Card title="Langfuse" icon="chart-line" href="#getting-started">
    Advanced tracing, metrics, and debugging tools
  </Card>
  <Card title="AgentOps" icon="gauge-high" href="#getting-started">

  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

We currently recommend [**Langfuse**](https://langfuse.com/) because it is fully open source, easy to use, and offers the most comprehensive set of features and support. You can also combine it with other trackers for enhanced observability.

        <Accordion title="Configuration (Optional)">
          You can pass additional configuration options:

          ```python
          # Using environment variables with additional options
          init_tracking("langfuse", debug=True, host="custom-host", user_id="user-123")

          # Direct API key passing (useful for multi-user applications)
          init_tracking("langfuse", public_key="your-public-key", secret_key="your-secret-key")
          ```

        Or pass directly when initializing (for multi-user applications):
        ```python
        init_tracking("agentops", api_key="your-agentops-api-key")
        ```

## How It Works

Agency Swarm uses a simple but powerful tracking system that captures every interaction in your agent's lifecycle:

1. **Event Tracking**: Every message, tool call, and error is automatically tracked with unique IDs and timestamps.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Events are organized in a tree structure, showing how different parts of your agent interact.
3. **Multiple Platforms**: You can send this data to different platforms (Langfuse, AgentOps, or local SQLite) for analysis.

The tracking system is built on top of Langchain's callback interface, which means it can work with any observability tool that supports Langchain. This gives you flexibility while keeping the implementation simple.

### What Gets Tracked

The system automatically captures:
- **Messages**: Every conversation between users and agents
- **Tool Calls**: When agents use tools and their results
- **Errors**: Any issues that occur during execution
- **Performance**: Token usage, timing, and other metrics
- **Relationships**: How different parts of your agent interact

This data helps you understand your agent's behavior, debug issues, and optimize performance.
