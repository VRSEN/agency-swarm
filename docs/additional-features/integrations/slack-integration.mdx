# Slack Integration



### **Feature Overview:**


With Slack Integrations, you can create custom bots tailored to your workspace. These apps can be installed and managed within your workspace, enabling a wide range of automated functions and interactions.

Currently, the Slack bots created via agencii can respond in:

- **💬 Direct Messages (DMs):**

- **Public Chats** when mentioned by name (e.g., `@BotName`):

### Privacy Statement

🔒 When apps are created on our platform, we don't have access to your workspace or its members. The OAuth permissions requested are minimal and support only the app's core functions. You can revoke the OAuth token from Slack at any time. You retain ownership of the app and can distribute it freely, regardless of user growth. For your privacy, **messages are not stored in our database**.

## **Creating a Slack Application**

To create a Slack application on your workspace, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Provide Basic Details**

1.  **Select Your Agent:** Select the agent to be integrated into your slack app. This agent will be used to generate responses.

2.  **Set the Integration Name:** This name refers to the bot's name, which will be used to mention it in public chats. Typically, you might want to set it to you agent name, although you can make it different if you wish.

3.  **Provide an Integration Description:** This is a short description of your bot, used for reference only. (So you don’t forget why you created it)

### Step 2: **Create a Slack App**

💡 **Note:** Keep your credentials secure to prevent potential exposure of your app.

### **Step 3: Finish Your Installation**

1. Once your app credentials are entered, click "Install on Slack."
    1. Alternatively, you can copy an installation link and send it to your client, or another workspace owner.
2. **Grant Permission:** Slack will prompt you to grant permission to exchange the OAuth token. Click “Allow” to sync your app with the integration.
