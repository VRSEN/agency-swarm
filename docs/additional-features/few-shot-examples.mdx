**Few-shot prompting** is a powerful technique where you provide a small number of sample interactions (typically 2 to 5) to guide your agent's behavior. This method helps the agent understand the desired output format and task requirements by learning from the given examples, thereby improving performance without writing extensive instructions.

## Crafting Effective Examples

- **Provide Task Demonstrations**: Use examples that clearly illustrate the tasks that your agents will perform.
- **Use Realistic Scenarios**: Include interactions that mirror actual conversations that your agent will handle.
- **Use Preferred Tone and Style**: Ensure the agent's replies in your examples match your desired brand voice.

## Defining Few-Shot Examples

In the **Agency Swarm** framework, few-shot examples are structured using the [OpenAI message object format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage), including the `role` and `content` fields.

**Example**: Technical Support Agent:

```python
examples = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "My device won't turn on.",
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm sorry to hear that. Let's try some troubleshooting steps. First, please press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds.",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I tried that, but it still won't turn on.",
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Thank you for trying that. Please connect your device to a charger and check if any lights appear. Let me know what you observe.",
    }
]
```

The optional fields `attachments` and `metadata` can be included if needed but are not required for basic examples.

## Using Few-Shot Examples

You can add few-shot examples to your agent either during initialization or afterward:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="During Initialization">

    ```python
    from agency_swarm import Agent

    agent = Agent(
        name="CustomerSupportAgent",
        description="Assists customers with inquiries and provides detailed information.",
        examples=examples
    )
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="After Initialization">
    <Warning>
    This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.x).  
    For newer versions, consider adding examples to agent's `instructions` parameter.
    </Warning>

    ```python
    agent = Agent(name="CustomerSupportAgent")
    agent.examples = examples
    ```

    </Tab>
