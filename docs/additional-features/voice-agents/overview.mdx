Agency Swarm reuses your existing `Agent` definitions for voice. This page shows how to adapt agents for spoken conversations; deployment lives on the dedicated [Deployment](./deployment) guide.

## What you can build

- **Phone receptionist** — answers calls, routes to specialists, captures caller details.
- **Live support triage** — gathers context, lets callers interrupt, and escalates to a human or another agent.
- **Language coach** — listens, corrects pronunciation, and keeps the dialogue short and encouraging.

## Prerequisites

- Access to OpenAI Realtime models (`gpt-realtime` or `gpt-realtime-mini` are the recommended latest options).
- `agency-swarm` with FastAPI extras:

```bash
pip install "agency-swarm[fastapi]"
```

## Define your agent (same API)

You keep using the standard `Agent` class—voice agents are regular agents with the same tools, handoffs, and instructions.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def lookup_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Return a short order status by ID."""
    return f"Order {order_id} has shipped and will arrive soon."

voice_agent = Agent(
    name="Voice Concierge",
    instructions=(
        "You are a friendly concierge. Answer in one or two sentences and offer to look up order "
        "details when the caller mentions a number."
    ),
    tools=[lookup_order],
)
```

<Tip>
If you've already built your agency, you do not need to change anything!
</Tip>

## Add handoffs (optional)

Handoffs work exactly as they do in text mode. Register your flows once and they will carry over to voice sessions.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent
from agency_swarm.tools import SendMessageHandoff

billing = Agent(name="Billing", instructions="Handle billing questions briefly.")
faq = Agent(name="FAQ", instructions="Answer frequently asked questions.")

concierge = Agent(
    name="Concierge",
    instructions="Greet the caller, collect intent, then hand off when a specialist is needed.",
)

agency = Agency(
    concierge,
    communication_flows=[
        (concierge > billing, SendMessageHandoff),
        (concierge > faq, SendMessageHandoff),
    ],
)
```

When the concierge invokes `SendMessageHandoff`, the realtime session routes audio and tool access to the designated specialist agent.

## Troubleshooting

- **Realtime access errors** — ensure the API key you load before launch has the `gpt-realtime` (or compatible) capability; the helper surfaces the HTTP status code in the logs.
- **Call feels slow** — keep agent instructions concise and offload long-running work to tools so the model can respond within the audio budget.
