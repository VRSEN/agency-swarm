Agency Swarm reuses your existing `Agent` definitions for voice. This page shows how to adapt agents for spoken conversations; deployment lives on the dedicated [Deployment](./deployment) guide.

## What you can build

- **Phone receptionist** — answers calls, routes to specialists, captures caller details.
- **Live support triage** — gathers context, lets callers interrupt, and escalates to a human or another agent.
- **Language coach** — listens, corrects pronunciation, and keeps the dialogue short and encouraging.

## Prerequisites

- Access to OpenAI Realtime models (`gpt-realtime` or `gpt-realtime-mini` are the recommended latest options).
- `agency-swarm` with FastAPI extras:

```bash
pip install "agency-swarm[fastapi]"
```

## Define your agent (same API)

You keep using the standard `Agent` class—voice agents are regular agents with the same tools, handoffs, and instructions.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def lookup_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Return a short order status by ID."""
    return f"Order {order_id} has shipped and will arrive soon."

voice_agent = Agent(
    name="Voice Concierge",
    instructions=(
        "You are a friendly concierge. Answer in one or two sentences and offer to look up order "
        "details when the caller mentions a number."
    ),
    tools=[lookup_order],
)
```

<Tip>
If you already have a typed Agency Swarm agent, you do not need to change the class—voice uses the same instance.
</Tip>

## Try it instantly

Hear the experience without writing server code by running the packaged demo:

```bash
python -m examples.interactive.realtime.demo
```

The script launches a local FastAPI bridge and serves a browser client at `http://localhost:8000`. Edit `examples/interactive/realtime/demo.py` to swap in your agent, tweak the greeting, or change the tool list.

<Note>
The packaged UI comes from OpenAI’s realtime reference app and ships with Agency Swarm. Run the scripts in `examples/interactive/realtime/` to launch it locally, or browse the source at [github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/tree/main/examples/interactive/realtime](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/tree/main/examples/interactive/realtime).
</Note>

## Add handoffs (optional)

Handoffs work exactly as they do in text mode. Register your flows once and they will carry over to voice sessions.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent
from agency_swarm.tools import SendMessageHandoff

billing = Agent(name="Billing", instructions="Handle billing questions briefly.")
faq = Agent(name="FAQ", instructions="Answer frequently asked questions.")

concierge = Agent(
    name="Concierge",
    instructions="Greet the caller, collect intent, then hand off when a specialist is needed.",
)

agency = Agency(
    concierge,
    communication_flows=[
        (concierge > billing, SendMessageHandoff),
        (concierge > faq, SendMessageHandoff),
    ],
)
```

When the concierge invokes `SendMessageHandoff`, the realtime session routes audio and tool access to the designated specialist agent.

## Next steps

- [Deploy your voice agents](./deployment) for FastAPI control, browser clients, and Twilio phone calls.
- Explore the generated demo UI in `src/agency_swarm/ui/demos/realtime/app` to customise the web experience.
- Review OpenAI’s realtime [Quickstart](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/realtime/quickstart/) and [Guide](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/realtime/guide/) for protocol details—Agency Swarm builds on those primitives.

## Troubleshooting

- **Realtime access errors** — ensure the API key you load before launch has the `gpt-realtime` (or compatible) capability; the helper surfaces the HTTP status code in the logs.
- **Call feels slow** — keep agent instructions concise and offload long-running work to tools so the model can respond within the audio budget.
