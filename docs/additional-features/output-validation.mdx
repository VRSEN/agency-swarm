Validating the outputs of agents and tools is crucial for building reliable and secure AI agents. Validators help ensure data integrity and handle LLM hallucinations.

## Validators

There are 4 different validators in Agency Swarm:

- Tool validators:
  - `field_validator`: Validate individual fields independently.
  - `model_validator`: Perform complex checks involving multiple fields.
- Agent validators:
  - `guardrails` (for v1.x and higher) or `response_validator` (for v0.x): Validate the response before sending it to the user or other agents.
- Universal validators:
  - `llm_validator` (v0.x): Validate outputs against specified natural language rules.

### Agent Response Validator

<Tabs>
<Tab title="v1.x">

In v1.x, validation is handled through **guardrails** using the agents SDK. Guardrails provide more flexible validation for both input and output.

#### Output Guardrails

Output guardrails validate agent responses before they are sent to users or other agents. Each output guardrail function receives three parameters: `context`, `agent`, and `response_text`.

In most cases, you'll only need the `response_text` parameter, which contains the agent's latest response as a simple text string. This allows you to check the response against specific criteria.

For more complex validation scenarios, you can utilize the `context` and `agent` parameters to account for run state and agent configuration during validation.

**Example:**

```python
from agency_swarm import (
    Agency,
    Agent,
    RunContextWrapper,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    output_guardrail,
)

@output_guardrail
async def response_content_guardrail(
    context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent, response_text: str
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    tripwire_triggered = False
    output_info = ""

    if "bad word" in response_text.lower():
        tripwire_triggered = True
        output_info = "Please avoid using inappropriate language."

    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=output_info,
        tripwire_triggered=tripwire_triggered,
    )

agent = Agent(
    name="CustomerSupportAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent.",
    output_guardrails=[response_content_guardrail],
)
```

#### Validation Attempts

The `validation_attempts` parameter controls how many times an agent can retry when output validation fails. **Default is 1** (one retry). Set `validation_attempts=0` for immediate fail-fast behavior.
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="CustomerSupportAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent.",
    output_guardrails=[response_content_guardrail],
    validation_attempts=2,
)
```
After the guardrail error is triggered, the agent will receive the error message provided in the `output_info` in the form of a system message and will adjust its output accordingly.

#### Output Guardrail Exceptions
After all validation attempts fail, the `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` error will be raised to allow for additional processing, if needed.

```python
try:
    response = await agency.get_response("Hello!")
except OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e.guardrail_result.output_info}")
```

#### Input Guardrails

Input guardrails validate incoming messages before they reach the agent. They can check both user input and inter-agent communication.

**Simplified Input Processing**

Agency Swarm simplifies guardrail implementation by automatically extracting text content from messages. While the Agents SDK originally passes the entire chat history to guardrails, Agency Swarm wraps your guardrail functions to provide only the relevant text content, eliminating the need for manual extraction logic.

**Parameters and Input Types**

Each input guardrail receives three parameters: `context`, `agent`, and `user_input`. The `user_input` parameter format depends on the message structure:

- **Single message**: A string containing the message content
- **Multiple consecutive messages**: A list of strings, one for each message

For example, when a user sends multiple messages:
```json
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}
]
```

Your guardrail will receive:
```python
["Hi", "How are you?"]
```

This allows you to process each new input message individually or validate them as a group.

<Note>
Note that file and image inputs inside of a user message will not be passed to the guardrail.
</Note>

**Example:**

```python
from agency_swarm import (
    Agency,
    Agent,
    RunContextWrapper,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    input_guardrail,
)

@input_guardrail
async def require_task_prefix(
    context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent, user_input: str | list[str]
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    """Require user requests to begin with 'Request:'"""
    
    # Handle single string input
    condition = not user_input.startswith("Request:")
    
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info="Prefix your request with 'Request:' describing what you need." if condition else "",
        tripwire_triggered=condition,
    )

agent = Agent(
    name="CustomerSupportAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent.",
    input_guardrails=[require_task_prefix],
)
```

#### Input Guardrail Return Format

Agent's configuration includes an optional parameter called `return_input_guardrail_errors`, which defines how the guardrail error will be processed and presented to the caller:
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="CustomerSupportAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent.",
    input_guardrails=[require_task_prefix],
    return_input_guardrail_errors=True,
)
```
If set to `False`, triggering a guardrail will raise a corresponding exception, as described in the next section.        
If set to `True` (its default value), the guardrail error will be returned to the user/caller agent as if it were a genuine response from the recipient. For example, using the agent above:
```python
response = await agency.get_response("Hello!")
print(response.final_output)
```
This will not raise an exception; however, the `response.final_output` will contain the guardrail's error message. In this case, it will be:    
`"Prefix your request with 'Request:' describing what you need."`     

For streaming responses, it will emit an extra event at the end of the stream in the following format:
```text
RunItemStreamEvent(
    name='message_output_created', 
    item=MessageOutputItem(
        agent=<Agent name='CustomerSupportAgent' desc='' model='unknown'>, 
        raw_item=ResponseOutputMessage(
            id='msg_input_guardrail_guidance', 
            content=[
                ResponseOutputText(
                    annotations=[], 
                    text="Prefix your request with 'Request:' describing what you need.", 
                    type='output_text', 
                    logprobs=None
                )
            ],
            role='assistant', 
            status='completed', 
            type='message'
        ), 
        type='message_output_item'
    ), 
    type='run_item_stream_event'
)
```
This event will always have an id set to `msg_input_guardrail_guidance`, so you can further differentiate it, if needed.

**When to use:** This feature's primary focus is to simplify building user-facing applications and make the user experience more fluid. 
When using this feature, you won't have to add any exception handlers for the input guardrails. Instead, users will receive the response as if it were coming from the agent, so they can adjust their input accordingly.

<Note>
While having this feature turned on produces an agent's response, that response is purely artificial and will not be registered in the thread history.   
Instead, an appropriate system message will be added in order to log a guardrail error.
</Note>

#### Input Guardrail Exceptions
Unlike output guardrails, if an input guardrail exception is raised (`return_input_guardrail_errors` should be set to `False` for that to happen), the error will be immediately returned back to the user/caller agent.     
For user messages, the error processing is similar to output guardrails.

```python
try:
    response = await agency.get_response("Hello!")
except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e.guardrail_result.output_info}")
```

Each triggered guardrail will also leave a corresponding system message containing error message inside of a chat history. Regardless of the `return_input_guardrail_errors` parameter value.

<Note>
The validation_attempts parameter currently does not apply to input guardrails.
</Note>

#### Agent-to-agent message validation
You can use guardrails to control how agents send messages and responses to one another.
When adding communication flows between agents, the guardrails of the recipient agent will define the format of input and output messages, for example:

```python
@input_guardrail(name="RequireTaskPrefix")
async def require_task_prefix(
    context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent, agent_input: str | list[str]
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    condition = not agent_input.startswith("Task:")
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info="ERROR: Requests to this agent must begin with 'Task:'" if condition else "",
        tripwire_triggered=condition,
    )


@output_guardrail(name="RequireResponsePrefix")
async def require_response_prefix(
    context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent, response_text: str
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    condition = not response_text.startswith("Response:")
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info="ERROR: Your response must start with 'Response:'" if condition else "",
        tripwire_triggered=condition,
    )

ceo = Agent(
    name="CEO",
    instructions="You are the CEO agent.",
)

worker = Agent(
    name="Worker",
    instructions="You are the worker agent.",
    input_guardrails=[require_task_prefix],
    output_guardrails=[require_response_prefix],
    return_input_guardrail_errors=False,
)

agency = Agency(
    ceo,
    communication_flows=[(ceo, worker)],
)
```
In this example, if the CEO agent sends a message to the worker that does not start with the word "Task:", the input guardrail will be triggered and
the CEO will be notified with an error message saying `"ERROR: Requests to this agent must begin with 'Task:'"`. Then it will either adjust the input
and try again or notify the user, as per its instructions.

<Note>
Agent-to-agent messages are always single strings, so if you are using a guardrail exclusively to check inter-agent communication, input guardrail will always receive a string.
</Note>

Similarly, the response of the worker to the CEO agent will be checked against the output guardrail and within
the specified number of `validation_attempts` it will need to generate a correct response. In this case, the requirement is that the worker's response should start with
the word "Response:", otherwise it will receive the error message `"ERROR: Your response must start with 'Response:'"`

It is recommended to set `return_input_guardrail_errors=False` for the agency's internal agents. While `True` value is also supported, setting it to `False` will add an
extra error prefix to the recipient's response to indicate the issue and avoid potential confusion.

<Warning>
Due to the nature of Handoffs, using SendMessageHandoff for agent-to-agent communication will bypass input guardrails set between agents.
</Warning>

<Tab title="v0.x">

<Info>
This is the previous production version. Install with: `pip install agency-swarm<1.0.0`
</Info>

You can define a `response_validator` method inside your Agent class to validate responses before sending them to the user or other agents. This method should raise an error if the response is invalid, allowing the agent to handle the error and generate a corrected response.

**Example:**

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

class CustomerSupportAgent(Agent):
    def response_validator(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Validate the response before sending it."""
        if "bad word" in message.lower():
            raise ValueError("Please avoid using inappropriate language.")
        return message
```

In this example, `CustomerSupportAgent` checks the response for the presence of "bad word" and raises a `ValueError` if it is found. The error is passed to the Agent to generate a corrected response.

#### Validation Attempts

The `validation_attempts` parameter controls how many times an agent can retry when validation fails. **Default is 1** (one retry). Set `validation_attempts=0` for immediate fail-fast behavior.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

class JSONAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
            validation_attempts=3,  # Allow 2 retries for learning
            **kwargs
        )

    def response_validator(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Validate JSON format."""
        try:
            json.loads(message)
            return message
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            raise ValueError("Response must be valid JSON format.")
```

**When to adjust `validation_attempts`:**
- **Format validation** (JSON, structured output): Use `validation_attempts=2-3`
- **Content requirements** that agents can learn: Use `validation_attempts=2`
- **Critical/security validation**: Use `validation_attempts=0` to disable retries

### Tool Validators

When defining tools, you can use Pydantic validators to prevent invalid data from being passed to the tool by the calling agent.

There are 2 types of validators used specifically in tools: field-level and model-level validators. Here is the comparison table to help you understand the difference between them:

| Type   | Purpose                                                        | Usage                                                                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Field Validators** | Validate individual fields independently.                      | Use the `@field_validator` decorator on methods, specifying the field(s) to validate.                                |
| **Model Validators** | Validate the entire model, allowing checks involving multiple fields. | Use the `@model_validator` decorator on methods.                                                                   |

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Field Validators" defaultOpen={true}>
This example ensures that the `username` field does not contain spaces using a field validator:

```python
from pydantic import field_validator
from agency_swarm import BaseTool

class User(BaseTool):
    username: str

    @field_validator('username')
    @classmethod
    def validate_username(cls, value):
        if ' ' in value:
            raise ValueError('Username must not contain spaces.')
        return value
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Model Validators">
In this example, a model validator checks that `password` and `confirm_password` match, which requires access to multiple fields:
```python
from pydantic import model_validator
from agency_swarm import BaseTool

class User(BaseTool):
    password: str
    confirm_password: str

    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def check_passwords_match(self):
        if self.password != self.confirm_password:
            raise ValueError('Passwords do not match.')
        return self
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### LLM Validator (v0.x)

The `llm_validator` validates outputs against specified natural language rules. (v0.x)

**Example:**

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage
from agency_swarm.util.validators import llm_validator
from pydantic import model_validator

class SendMessageLLMValidation(SendMessage):
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_recipient(self):
        if self.recipient == "CustomerSupportAgent":
            llm_validator(
                statement="The message is related to customer support."
            )(self.message)
        return self
```

In this example, the `llm_validator` will throw an error if the message is not related to customer support. The caller agent will then have to fix the recipient or the message and send it again.

<Note>
Since `llm_validator` uses LLMs for validation, it may incur additional costs and latency due to extra API calls. Use it for fields that require complex validation beyond simple checks.
</Note>

By combining all the validators described above, you can create validation logic to ensure your agents and tools perform reliably.
