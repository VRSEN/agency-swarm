In the following sections, we'll look at some common use cases for creating custom communication flows and how to implement them in Agency Swarm.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="v1.x">

#### 1. Adjusting Parameters and Descriptions

Customize parameters by subclassing `SendMessage` and declaring extra fields via a Pydantic model. Avoid mutating JSON schema directly:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage

class SendMessageTask(SendMessage):
    """Use this tool to send tasks to other agents within your agency."""

    class ExtraParams(BaseModel):
        chain_of_thought: str = Field(
            description=(
                "Think step-by-step about how to solve your current task, then break it down into smaller steps for the recipient agent."
            )
        )
        task: str = Field(
            description=(
                "Specify the task required for the recipient agent to complete. Focus on clarifying what the task entails rather than providing exact instructions."
            )
        )

    def __init__(self, sender_agent, recipients=None):
        super().__init__(sender_agent, recipients)
        self.name = "send_message_task"
```

#### 2. Adding Additional Fields

You can add extra fields to capture more context, like key moments and decisions:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage

class SendMessageWithContext(SendMessage):
    """SendMessage with key moments and decisions tracking."""

    class ExtraParams(BaseModel):
        key_moments: str = Field(
            description=(
                "Document critical moments and decision points from the current conversation "
                "that the recipient agent needs to understand. Include context about what "
                "has been decided or prioritized that will guide the recipient's tool selection "
                "and task execution. For example: 'User decided to prioritize performance over cost', "
                "'Analysis focus shifted to Q4 optimization', etc."
            )
        )
        decisions: str = Field(
            description=(
                "Summarize the specific decisions made that will directly impact which tools "
                "or approaches the recipient agent should use. Be explicit about choices that "
                "narrow down the scope of work. For example: 'Prioritized performance analysis "
                "over cost reduction', 'Selected React over Vue for frontend', etc. This helps "
                "the recipient agent choose the most appropriate tools and approach."
            )
        )

    def __init__(self, sender_agent, recipients=None):
        super().__init__(sender_agent, recipients)
        self.name = "send_message_with_context"
```
In v1.x, use guardrails; `llm_validator` is v0.x (see https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/).

**Usage:**

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    send_message_tool_class=SendMessageWithContext,  # Use your custom class
)

agency = Agency(agent, communication_flows=[(agent, other_agent)]))
```

<Info>
This is the previous production version. Install with: `pip install agency-swarm<1.0.0`

#### 1. Adjusting parameters and descriptions

The most basic use case is if you want to use your own parameter descriptions, such as if you want to change the docstring or the description of the `message` parameter. This can help you better customize how the agents communicate with each other and what information they relay.

Let's say that instead of sending messages, I want my agents to send tasks to each other. In this case, I can change the docstring and the `message` parameter to a `task` parameter to better fit the nature of my application.

```python
from pydantic import Field
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessageBase

class SendMessageTask(SendMessageBase):
    """Use this tool to send tasks to other agents within your agency."""
    chain_of_thought: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Please think step-by-step about how to solve your current task, provided by the user. Then, break down this task into smaller steps and issue each step individually to the recipient agent via the task parameter."
    )
    task: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Specify the task required for the recipient agent to complete. Focus on clarifying what the task entails, rather than providing exact instructions. Make sure to include all the relevant information needed to complete the task."
    )

    def run(self):
        return self._get_completion(message=self.task)
```

To remove the chain of thought, you can simply remove the `chain_of_thought` parameter.

#### 2. Adding custom validation logic

Now, let's say that I need to ensure that my message is sent to the correct recipient agent. (This is a very common hallucination in production.) In this case, I can add a custom validator to the `recipient` parameter, which is defined in the `SendMessageBase` class. Since I don't want to change any other parameters or descriptions, I can inherit the default `SendMessage` class and only add this new validation logic.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage
from pydantic import model_validator

class SendMessageValidation(SendMessage):
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_recipient(self):
        if "customer support" not in self.message.lower() and self.recipient == "CustomerSupportAgent":
            raise ValueError("Messages not related to customer support cannot be sent to the customer support agent.")
        return self
```

You can, of course, also use GPT for this:

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage
from agency_swarm.util.validators import llm_validator
from pydantic import model_validator

class SendMessageLLMValidation(SendMessage):
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_recipient(self):
        if self.recipient == "CustomerSupportAgent":
            llm_validator(
                statement="The message is related to customer support."
            )(self.message)
        return self
```

In this example, the `llm_validator` will throw an error if the message is not related to customer support. The caller agent will then have to fix the recipient or the message and send it again! This is extremely useful when you have a lot of agents.

#### 3. Summarizing previous conversations with other agents and adding to context

Sometimes, when using default `SendMessage`, the agents might not relay all the necessary details to the recipient agent, especially when the previous conversation is too long. In this case, you can summarize the previous conversation with GPT and add it to the context, instead of the additional instructions. I will extend the `SendMessageQuick` class, which already contains the `message` parameter, as I don't need chain of thought or files in this case.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessageQuick
from agency_swarm.util.oai import get_openai_client

class SendMessageSummary(SendMessageQuick):
    def run(self):
        client = get_openai_client()
        thread = self._get_main_thread() # get the main thread (conversation with the user)

        # get the previous messages
        previous_messages = thread.get_messages()
        previous_messages_str = "\n".join([f"{m.role}: {m.content[0].text.value}" for m in previous_messages])

        # summarize the previous conversation
        summary = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a world-class summarizer. Please summarize the following conversation in a few sentences:"},
                {"role": "user", "content": previous_messages_str}
            ]
        )

        # send the message with the summary
        return self._get_completion(message=self.message, additional_instructions=f"\n\nPrevious conversation summary: '{summary.choices[0].message.content}'")
```

With this example, you can add your own custom logic to the `run` method. It does not have to be a summary; you can also use it to add any other information to the context. For example, you can even query a vector database or use an external API.

#### 4. Running each agent in a separate API call

If you are a PRO, and you have managed to deploy each agent in a separate API endpoint, instead of using `_get_completion()`, you can call your own API and let the agents communicate with each other over the internet.

```python
import requests
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage

class SendMessageAPI(SendMessage):
    def run(self):
        response = requests.post(
            "https://your-api-endpoint.com/send-message",
            json={"message": self.message, "recipient": self.recipient}
        )
        return response.json()["message"]
```

This is very powerful, as you can even allow your agents to collaborate with agents outside your system. More on this is coming soon!

**After implementing your own `SendMessage` tool**, simply pass it into the `send_message_tool_class` parameter when initializing the `Agency` class:

```python
agency = Agency(
    ...
    send_message_tool_class=SendMessageAPI
)
```

That's it! Now, your agents will use your own custom `SendMessageAPI` class for communication!
