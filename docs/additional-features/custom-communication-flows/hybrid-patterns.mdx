Agency Swarm supports two powerful paradigms for inter-agent communication that can work together seamlessly: **SendMessage tools** (orchestrator pattern) and **OpenAI SDK Handoffs** (sequential pattern). This guide explains how these patterns interact and provides practical examples for building sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## Understanding the Two Paradigms

### SendMessage Tools (Orchestrator Pattern)
- **Control Flow**: Control **returns** to the calling agent
- **Use Case**: Delegation with oversight and coordination
- **Implementation**: Via `SendMessage` tool variants
- **Example**: `Orchestrator -> Worker -> Response to Orchestrator`

### Handoffs (Sequential Pattern)
- **Control Flow**: Control **transfers** to the handoff target
- **Use Case**: Complete task delegation and specialization
- **Implementation**: Via `SendMessageHandoff` tool class + OpenAI SDK
- **Example**: `Worker -> Specialist` (control stays with Specialist)

## The Hybrid Resolution

When both patterns are used together, you can use Agency Swarm to implement a **hybrid approach** that allows both to coexist without conflicts:

### How It Works

The hybrid approach works by layering the two communication patterns strategically:

1. **Primary Communication Uses Orchestrator Pattern**
   - When Agent A sends a message to Agent B using `SendMessage`, Agent B will **always** send its response back to Agent A
   - This ensures predictable communication flow - you always know where responses will go

2. **Internal Processing Can Use Handoffs**
   - While Agent B is working on Agent A's request, Agent B can consult with specialist agents using handoffs
   - Specialist gets the full context, as received by the Agent B.
   - Agent B gathers insights from specialists before formulating its final response.

3. **Best of Both Worlds**
   - Agent A gets the coordination benefits of the orchestrator pattern (responses come back)
   - Agent B gets the specialization benefits of handoffs (can consult experts)
   - The final response to Agent A includes a summary of the specialist knowledge (as an output of SendMessage), without needing to manage multiple conversations

## Setting Up Handoffs

In this library, handoffs are configured via the `SendMessageHandoff` tool.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent
from agency_swarm.tools import SendMessageHandoff

# Create specialized agents
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="ProjectManager",
    instructions="Coordinate project tasks and oversee completion",
    # ... other config
)

worker = Agent(
    name="Developer",
    instructions="Handle development tasks, consult specialists when needed",
    send_message_tool_class=SendMessageHandoff,
    # ... other config
)

specialist = Agent(
    name="SecurityExpert",
    instructions="Provide security expertise and recommendations",
    # Agent description will be added to the handoff tool instructions
    description="Provides security expertise and recommendations",
    # ... other config
)

# Create agency with communication flows
agency = Agency(
    orchestrator,
    communication_flows=[
        (orchestrator, worker),      # Creates send_message_to_Developer tool
        (orchestrator, specialist),  # Creates send_message_to_SecurityExpert tool
        (worker, specialist),        # Creates a handoff from worker to specialist (since worker has a special send message class)
    ]
)
```

### Execution Flow

1. **ProjectManager** uses `send_message_to_Developer`: *"Implement user authentication with security best practices"*

2. **Developer** receives the task and decides to consult the security expert

3. **Developer** hands off to **SecurityExpert** (internal to Developer's execution)

4. **SecurityExpert** provides security recommendations

5. **Developer** incorporates the expert advice and responds to **ProjectManager**

6. **ProjectManager** receives a comprehensive response with security considerations included

## When to Use Hybrid Patterns

### ‚úÖ Ideal Use Cases

- **Hierarchical task delegation with oversight**: Manager needs visibility but workers need specialist consultation
- **Expert consultation workflows**: Agents can consult specialists while maintaining orchestrator control
- **Complex approval processes**: Multiple specialists review work before returning to orchestrator
- **Quality assurance pipelines**: Work flows through specialists but orchestrator tracks progress

### üéØ Design Guidelines

**Use SendMessage when you need**:
- Control and visibility
- Coordination between multiple agents
- Task-focused agent boundaries

**Use Sequential Handoffs when you need**:
- Internal agent decision-making
- Agents to have entire context
- Limit the amount of agent-to-agent passes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: In this library, handoffs must be configured using `SendMessageHandoff` tools only. The `agent.handoffs` parameter is not supported.

## Benefits of the Hybrid Approach

‚úÖ **Internal Delegation**: Agents can independently use handoffs to access necessary context and tools without additional agent-to-agent passes.       
‚úÖ **Maintained Control**: Some agents can receive a short summary of the response to avoid hallucinations while other can receive full context to increase response accuracy and coverage.    
‚úÖ **Clean Separation of Concerns**: High-level coordination remains simple while detailed specialist work happens independently within appropriate agents.

## Conclusion

Agency Swarm's hybrid paradigm resolution enables sophisticated multi-agent architectures that would be difficult to achieve with either pattern alone. 
By understanding how SendMessage tools and Sequential Handoffs work together, you can build powerful systems that combine the best of both orchestration 
and sequential delegation patterns, giving you the flexibility to design complex multi-agent workflows.
