Multi-agent communication is the core functionality of any Multi-Agent System. Unlike in all other frameworks, Agency Swarm not only allows you to define communication flows in any way you want (uniform communication flows), but also to configure the underlying logic for this feature. This means that you can create entirely new types of communication or adjust it to your own needs. Below you will find a guide on how to do all this, along with some common examples.

Communication flows are handled through custom `SendMessage` tools that extend the `FunctionTool` class from the agents SDK. The system provides a flexible foundation for creating custom communication patterns tailored to your specific needs.

## Configuring SendMessage Tools

You can customize communication by setting a custom `send_message_tool_class` on individual agents:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency, Agent
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessage

class CustomSendMessage(SendMessage):
    # Your custom implementation
    pass

agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    send_message_tool_class=CustomSendMessage,
)

agency = Agency(agent)
```

## Default SendMessage Implementation

The default `SendMessage` class extends `FunctionTool` from the agents SDK. Here's how it's structured:

### Key Components

**1. Class Structure:**
```python
from agents import FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper
from agency_swarm.context import MasterContext

class SendMessage(FunctionTool):
    """
    Use this tool to facilitate direct, synchronous communication between specialized agents within your agency.
    """
```
- Extends `FunctionTool` from the agents SDK
- Each SendMessage instance is created dynamically for specific sender->recipient pairs

**2. Dynamic Initialization:**
```python
def __init__(self, sender_agent, recipient_agent, tool_name):
    params_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "my_primary_instructions": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Please repeat your primary instructions step-by-step..."
            },
            "message": {
                "type": "string", 
                "description": "Specify the task required for the recipient agent to complete..."
            },
            "additional_instructions": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Optional. Additional context or instructions..."
            }
        },
        "required": ["my_primary_instructions", "message", "additional_instructions"]
    }
```
- **`params_schema`**: Defines the JSON schema for tool parameters and validation
- **Dynamic tool naming**: Each tool gets a unique name like "send_message_to_[AgentName]"
- **Recipient-specific description**: Tool description includes the recipient agent's role

**3. Tool Registration:**
```python
super().__init__(
    name=tool_name,
    description=f"{self.__doc__}\n\nRecipient role: {recipient_agent.description}",
    params_json_schema=params_schema,
    on_invoke_tool=self.on_invoke_tool,
)
```
- Registers the tool with the agents SDK
- Combines class docstring with recipient-specific information
- Links to the `on_invoke_tool` method for execution

**4. Communication Logic:**
```python
async def on_invoke_tool(self, wrapper: RunContextWrapper[MasterContext], arguments_json_string: str) -> str:
    # Parse JSON arguments
    kwargs = json.loads(arguments_json_string)
    message_content = kwargs.get("message")
    additional_instructions = kwargs.get("additional_instructions", "")
    
    # Call recipient agent
    response = await self.recipient_agent.get_response(
        message=message_content,
        sender_name=self.sender_agent.name,
        additional_instructions=additional_instructions,
    )
    return response.final_output
```
- **Async execution**: Uses `async/await` for non-blocking communication
- **JSON argument parsing**: Manually parses and validates tool arguments
- **Direct agent calls**: Calls `recipient_agent.get_response()` directly
- **Context passing**: Can access `MasterContext` for shared state

## Creating Custom Communication Flows

To create custom communication patterns, extend the base `SendMessage` class and modify the parameters schema or communication logic:

```python
class SendMessageWithContext(SendMessage):
    """SendMessage with enhanced context tracking."""

    def __init__(self, sender_agent, recipient_agent, tool_name):
        super().__init__(sender_agent, recipient_agent, tool_name)

        # Add custom fields to the schema
        self.params_json_schema["properties"]["key_moments"] = {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Document critical moments and decision points..."
        }
        self.params_json_schema["properties"]["decisions"] = {
            "type": "string", 
            "description": "Summarize specific decisions made..."
        }
        self.params_json_schema["required"].extend(["key_moments", "decisions"])
```

This approach provides complete flexibility for customizing inter-agent communication patterns while leveraging the agents SDK's robust foundation.

## Pre-Made SendMessage Classes

Agency Swarm contains multiple commonly requested classes for communication flows. Currently, the following classes are available:

| Class Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | When to Use                                                                                                    | Code Link                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SendMessage` (default)     | This is the default class for sending messages to other agents. It uses synchronous communication with basic COT (Chain of Thought) prompting and allows agents to relay files and modify system instructions for each other.             | Suitable for most use cases. Balances speed and functionality.                                                 | [link](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/agency_swarm/tools/send_message/SendMessage.py)               |
| `SendMessageQuick`          | A variant of the SendMessage class without Chain of Thought prompting, files, and additional instructions. It allows for faster communication without the overhead of COT.                                                                | Use for simpler use cases or when you want to save tokens and increase speed.                                  | [link](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/agency_swarm/tools/send_message/SendMessageQuick.py)          |
| `SendMessageAsyncThreading` | Similar to `SendMessage` but with `async_mode='threading'`. Each agent will execute asynchronously in a separate thread. In the meantime, the caller agent can continue the conversation with the user and check the results later.       | Use for asynchronous applications or when sub-agents take significant amounts of time to complete their tasks. | [link](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/agency_swarm/tools/send_message/SendMessageAsyncThreading.py) |
| `SendMessageSwarm`          | Instead of sending a message to another agent, it replaces the caller agent with the recipient agent, similar to [OpenAI's Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm). The recipient agent will then have access to the entire conversation. | When you need more granular control. It is not able to handle complex multi-step, multi-agent tasks.           | [link](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/agency_swarm/tools/send_message/SendMessageSwarm.py)          |

**To use any of the pre-made `SendMessage` classes**, simply put it in the `send_message_tool_class` parameter when initializing the `Agency` class:

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.send_message import SendMessageQuick

agency = Agency(
    ...
    send_message_tool_class=SendMessageQuick
)
```

That's it! Now, your agents will use your own custom `SendMessageQuick` class for communication.

## Creating Your Own Unique Communication Flows

To create your own communication flow, you will first need to extend the `SendMessageBase` class. This class extends the `BaseTool` class, like any other tools in Agency Swarm, and contains the most basic parameters required for communication, such as the `recipient_agent`.

### Default `SendMessage` Class

By default, Agency Swarm uses the following tool for communication:

```python
from pydantic import Field, field_validator, model_validator
from .SendMessageBase import SendMessageBase

class SendMessage(SendMessageBase):
    """Use this tool to facilitate direct, synchronous communication between specialized agents within your agency. When you send a message using this tool, you receive a response exclusively from the designated recipient agent. To continue the dialogue, invoke this tool again with the desired recipient agent and your follow-up message. Remember, communication here is synchronous; the recipient agent won't perform any tasks post-response. You are responsible for relaying the recipient agent's responses back to the user, as the user does not have direct access to these replies. Keep engaging with the tool for continuous interaction until the task is fully resolved. Do not send more than 1 message to the same recipient agent at the same time."""
    my_primary_instructions: str = Field(
        ...,
        description=(
            "Please repeat your primary instructions step-by-step, including both completed "
            "and the following next steps that you need to perform. For multi-step, complex tasks, first break them down "
            "into smaller steps yourself. Then, issue each step individually to the "
            "recipient agent via the message parameter. Each identified step should be "
            "sent in a separate message. Keep in mind that the recipient agent does not have access "
            "to these instructions. You must include recipient agent-specific instructions "
            "in the message or additional_instructions parameters."
        )
    )
    message: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Specify the task required for the recipient agent to complete. Focus on clarifying what the task entails, rather than providing exact instructions. Make sure to include all the relevant information needed to complete the task."
    )
    message_files: list[str] | None = Field(
        default=None,
        description="A list of file IDs to be sent as attachments to this message. Only use this if you have the file ID that starts with 'file-'.",
        examples=["file-1234", "file-5678"]
    )
    additional_instructions: Optional[str] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Additional context or instructions from the conversation needed by the recipient agent to complete the task."
    )

    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_files(self):
        # prevent hallucinations with agents sending file IDs into incorrect fields
        if "file-" in self.message or (self.additional_instructions and "file-" in self.additional_instructions):
            if not self.message_files:
                raise ValueError("You must include file IDs in message_files parameter.")
        return self


    def run(self):
        return self._get_completion(message=self.message,
                                    message_files=self.message_files,
                                    additional_instructions=self.additional_instructions)
```

Let's break down the code.

In general, all `SendMessage` tools have the following components:

1. **The Docstring**: This is used to generate a description of the tool for the agent. This part should clearly describe how your multi-agent communication works, along with some additional guidelines on how to use it.
2. **Parameters**: Parameters like `message`, `message_files`, `additional_instructions` are used to provide the recipient agent with the necessary information.
3. **The `run` method**: This is where the communication logic is implemented. Most of the time, you just need to map your parameters to `self._get_completion()` the same way you would call it in the `agency.get_completion()` method.

When creating your own `SendMessage` tools, you can use the above components as a template.

## Conclusion

Agency Swarm has been designed to give you, the developer, full control over your systems. It is the only framework that does not hard-code any prompts, parameters, or even worse, agents for you. With this new feature, the last part of the system that you couldn't fully customize to your own needs is now gone!

So, we want to encourage you to keep experimenting and designing your own unique communication flows. While the examples above should serve as a good starting point, they do not even merely scratch the surface of what's possible here! We are looking forward to seeing what you will create. Please share it in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7HcABDpFPG) so we can all learn from each other.
