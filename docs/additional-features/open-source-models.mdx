This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.7 and earlier)

While OpenAI is generally recommended, there are situations where you might prefer open-source models. The following projects offer alternatives by mimicking the Assistants API:

## Astra Assistants API

<Steps>

<Step title="1. Create an account on Astra Assistants API and obtain an API key." icon="user">
  Open the [Astra Assistants API](https://astra.datastax.com/signup) and create an account. Once you have an account,
  you can obtain an API key by clicking on the "Generate Token" button. ![Astra Assistants API
  Example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vrsen-ai/o/public%2Fgithub%2FScreenshot%202024-07-01%20at%208.19.00%E2%80%AFAM.png?alt=media&token=b4f1a7ad-3b77-40fa-a5da-866a4f1410bd)
</Step>

<Step title="2. Add Astra DB Token to your .env file:" icon="file">
Copy the token from the file that starts with "AstraCS:" and paste it into your `.env` file.

```env
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:dsfkgn...
```

</Step>

<Step title="3. Add other model provider API keys to .env as well:" icon="key">
```env
PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY=your_perplexityai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```
</Step>

<Step title="4. Install the Astra Assistants API and Gradio:" icon="download">
```bash
pip install astra-assistants-api gradio
```
</Step>

<Step title="5. Patch the OpenAI client:" icon="code">
```python
from openai import OpenAI
from astra_assistants import patch
from agency_swarm import set_openai_client
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = patch(OpenAI())

set_openai_client(client)
```
</Step>

<Step title="6. Create an agent:" icon="user-plus">
Create an agent and replace the `model` parameter with the name of the model you want to use. With Astra Assistants, you can upload files as usual using `files_folder`.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

ceo = Agent(
    name="ceo",
    description="I am the CEO",
    model='ollama/llama3',
    # model = 'perplexity/llama-3-8b-instruct'
    # model = 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'
    # model = 'groq/mixtral-8x7b-32768'
    # model="gpt-4o",
    files_folder="path/to/your/files"
)
```

</Step>

<Step title="7. Create an agency:" icon="people-arrows">
You can add more agents as needed, just ensure all manager agents support function calling.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency

agency = Agency([ceo])
```

</Step>

<Step title="8. Start Gradio:" icon="play">
To utilize your agency in Gradio, apply a specific non-streaming `demo_gradio` method from the [agency-swarm-lab](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm-lab/blob/main/OpenSourceSwarm/demo_gradio.py) repository:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from .demo_gradio import demo_gradio

agency = Agency([ceo])

demo_gradio(agency)
```

</Step>

</Steps>

**For complete examples, see the [implementation notebook](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/notebooks/os_models_with_astra_assistants_api.ipynb) and [official Astra Assistants examples](https://github.com/datastax/astra-assistants-api/tree/main/examples/python/agency-swarm).**

## General Instructions

To use agency-swarm with any other projects that mimic the Assistants API, generally, you need to follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the previous version of agency-swarm as most projects are not yet compatible with streaming and Assistants V2:">
```bash
pip install agency-swarm==0.1.7
```
</Step>

<Step title="Switch out the OpenAI client:">
```python
import openai
from agency_swarm import set_openai_client

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/")

set_openai_client(client)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Set the model parameter:">
```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

ceo = Agent(
    name="ceo",
    description="I am the CEO",
    model='ollama/llama3'
)
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start Gradio:">
To utilize your agency in Gradio, apply a specific non-streaming `demo_gradio` method from the [agency-swarm-lab](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm-lab/blob/main/OpenSourceSwarm/demo_gradio.py) repository:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from .demo_gradio import demo_gradio

agency = Agency([ceo])

demo_gradio(agency)
```

</Step>

<Step title="For backend integrations, simply use:">
```python
agency.get_completion("I am the CEO")
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Limitations

<Warning>
Be aware of the limitations when using open-source models.
</Warning>

- **Function calling is not supported by most open-source models**: This limitation prevents the agent from communicating with other agents in the agency. Therefore, it must be positioned at the end of the agency chart and cannot utilize any tools.
- **RAG is typically limited**: Most open-source assistants API implementations have restricted Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities. It is recommended to develop a custom tool with your own vector database.
- **Code Interpreter is not supported**: The Code Interpreter feature is still under development for all open-source assistants API implementations.

## Future Plans

Updates will be provided as new open-source assistant API implementations stabilize.

If you successfully integrate other projects with agency-swarm, please share your experience through an issue or pull request.
