<Warning>
This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.7 and earlier)
</Warning>

Many organizations prioritize data privacy and are cautious about sharing their data with any third-parties. By leveraging Azure OpenAI, you can ensure that your data is processed only within your own secure Azure environment, and not even shared with OpenAI itself.

<Info>
Running OpenAI models on Azure is the same as deploying your own open source model on any other cloud provider.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Create an Azure Account with an active subscription. [Create an account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
2. Get approved access to the OpenAI Service on Azure.
3. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in [one of the available regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#assistants-preview) and deploy a model to it.
4. Obtain the endpoint URL and API key for the OpenAI resource.

## Setting Up Azure OpenAI with Agency Swarm


<Steps>
<Step title="Configure the Azure OpenAI Client">
To use Azure OpenAI, you need to replace the default OpenAI client with the configured `AzureOpenAI` client:


```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from agency_swarm import set_openai_client
import os

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"),
    api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_ENDPOINT"),
    timeout=5,
    max_retries=5,
)

set_openai_client(client)
```


</Step>

<Step title="Update Agent Model Parameters">

Replace the `model` parameter inside each agent with your model deployment name from Azure.t:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

ceo = Agent(
    name="ceo",
    description="I am the CEO",
    model="azure-model-deployment-name"
)
```
<Note>
Model deployment name might be different from the stadard OpenAI model names. It is set by you when you deploy a model to Azure.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Run Your Agency">

After configuring the client and updating the agents, you can run your agency as usual:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency

agency = Agency([ceo])
agency.run_demo()
```
</Step>
</Steps>
