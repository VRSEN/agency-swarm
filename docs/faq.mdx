<AccordionGroup defaultOpen={true}>


<Accordion title="How do I set my OpenAI API key in my project?" icon="key">
Set your API key in your code:
```python
from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
```
Or use a `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234...
```
Then load it with:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="What's the difference between using .cursorrules (with Cursor IDE) and 'agency-swarm genesis'?" icon="scale-unbalanced">
There are two ways to create agents with AI:

1. [**Genesis Agency**:](/welcome/getting-started/genesis-agency) A simple command-line tool that helps you create basic agent structures. Great for getting started or simple use cases. Just run `agency-swarm genesis` and follow the prompts.

2. [**Cursor AI Code Editor**](/welcome/getting-started/cursor-ide): Use the `.cursorrules` file in Cursor IDE to create agents. This is the best option for both beginners and experienced developers since it gives you more control over the agent creation process.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Can I use open source models with Agency Swarm?" icon="code-fork">
Yes—you can use open source models for simple, non–mission-critical tasks (usually one or two tools per agent). See [Open Source Models](/additional-features/open-source-models) for more information. Keep in mind that many open source models currently struggle with function calling.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="How do I save and continue conversations?" icon="messages">
To persist conversations between application restarts, implement callbacks that save and load the full message history from a local file. For example, define your callback functions:

<CodeGroup>

```python v1.x
import os
import json
from agents import ConversationThread

def load_threads(chat_id: str) -> list[dict[str, TResponseInputItem]]:
    """Load all threads data for a specific chat session."""
    if os.path.exists(f"{chat_id}_threads.json"):
        with open(f"{chat_id}_threads.json", "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    return []

def save_threads(thread_dict: list[dict[str, TResponseInputItem]], chat_id: str):
    """Save all threads data to file."""
    with open(f"{chat_id}_threads.json", "w") as file:
        json.dump(thread_dict, file)

# Then, pass these callbacks during your agency initialization to resume conversations:
from agency_swarm import Agency
agency = Agency(
    agent,
    load_threads_callback=lambda: load_threads(chat_id),
    save_threads_callback=lambda thread_dict: save_threads(thread_dict, chat_id),
)
```

```python v0.x
import os
import json

def load_threads(chat_id):
    if os.path.exists(f"{chat_id}_threads.json"):
        with open(f"{chat_id}_threads.json", "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    return []

def save_threads(new_threads, chat_id):
    with open(f"{chat_id}_threads.json", "w") as file:
        json.dump(new_threads, file)

# Then, pass these callbacks during your agency initialization to resume conversations:
from agency_swarm.agency.genesis import GenesisAgency

agency = GenesisAgency(
    ...
    threads_callbacks={
        'load': lambda: load_threads(chat_id),
        'save': lambda new_threads: save_threads(new_threads, chat_id)
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

This setup preserves your conversation context between runs.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="How do I manage multiple users with Agency Swarm?" icon="users">
To support multiple users/chats, you need to load and save thread IDs in your database accordingly. Each chat/user should have unique thread IDs. Ensure to check out our [Deployment to Production](/additional-features/deployment-to-production) guide for more information.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="How can I transfer data between tools and agents?" icon="upload">
There are two ways to transfer data between tools and agents:
1. Use agency context inside your tools. Read more: [Agency Context](/additional-features/agency-context)
2. Create a tool (or modify an existing one) that uploads files to storage and outputs the file ID. This file ID can then be used by other tools or agents.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Why is the CodeInterpreter tool automatically added?" icon="code">
When file types like `.json`, `.docx`, or `.pptx` are uploaded, CodeInterpreter is auto-added to process them. To change the agent's behavior, update its instructions or create a custom file-handling tool.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="How can I serve an Agency as an API using FastAPI?" icon="book">
Embed your agency within a FastAPI endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```python v1.x
from fastapi import FastAPI
from uuid import uuid4

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(user_request: UserRequest):
    chat_id = user_request.chat_id or str(uuid4())

    agency = Agency(
        agent,
        load_threads_callback=lambda: load_threads(chat_id),
        save_threads_callback=lambda thread_dict: save_threads(thread_dict, chat_id)
    )

    response = await agency.get_response(user_request.message)
    return {"chat_id": chat_id, "response": response.final_output}

# Or use the built-in FastAPI integration
agency.run_fastapi(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

```python v0.x
from fastapi import FastAPI
from uuid import uuid4

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(user_request: UserRequest):
    chat_id = user_request.chat_id or str(uuid4())

    agency = Agency([...],
        threads_callbacks={
            'load': lambda: load_threads(chat_id),
            'save': lambda new_threads: save_threads(new_threads, chat_id)
        })

    response = agency.get_completion(user_request.message)
    return {"chat_id": chat_id, "response": response}
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="How do I deploy my agency to production?" icon="rocket">
Build a dedicated API backend (FastAPI is recommended) that manages authentication and persists thread state using callbacks. For more details, refer to our [Deployment to Production](/additional-features/deployment-to-production) guide.
