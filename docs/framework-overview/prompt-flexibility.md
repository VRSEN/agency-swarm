# Prompt Flexibility

The framework offers high flexibility in prompt design:

- **Custom Instructions**: Agents can be configured with unique instructions tailored to their roles.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Agents can be initialized with example conversations or task outputs for consistent behavior.
- **Dynamic Prompts**: Prompts can be adjusted programmatically based on context or specific needs.
- **No Hardcoded Constraints**: Developers have full control over the interaction flows and language used.
