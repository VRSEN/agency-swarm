# State Management

Agency Swarm provides basic state management through its shared memory system, enabling agents and tools to share global state. This ensures consistent task execution and prevents redundant or conflicting operations.

- **Shared State**: Agents and tools can read and write to a shared state to coordinate actions.
- **State Persistence**: States can be persisted across sessions, allowing for long-term task management.
- **Customization**: Developers can implement custom state handling for more complex applications.
