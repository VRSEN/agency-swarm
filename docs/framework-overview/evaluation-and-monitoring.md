# Evaluation and Monitoring

While Agency Swarm provides basic logging and debugging features, it allows developers to implement custom solutions for more comprehensive evaluation and monitoring.

- **Logging**: Tracks all agent interactions and tool calls for analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides insights into agent and tool efficiency, highlighting bottlenecks or errors.
- **Debugging Tools**: Can integrate with interfaces like Gradio for real-time interaction testing.
- **Custom Monitoring**: Hooks and callbacks can be implemented for detailed system analysis.
