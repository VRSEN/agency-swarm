# Streaming Support

Agency Swarm supports streaming responses from language models, providing real-time feedback during task execution.

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Enables agents to process and respond to inputs immediately.
- **Event Handlers**: Custom event handlers can be defined to manage and display streaming data.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Combined with asynchronous modes, streaming enhances the efficiency of multi-agent communication.
