# Conversation Context Management

Agency Swarm maintains conversation context through a shared memory system. This allows agents to:

- **Access Previous Interactions**: Agents can refer to earlier messages and decisions to maintain coherence.
- **Build Upon Information**: Agents can utilize data gathered by others, enhancing collaboration.
- **Maintain Multi-Turn Conversations**: Ensures that agents can engage in meaningful dialogues over multiple turns.

The framework leverages dynamic context truncation strategies to manage long conversations efficiently, keeping the most relevant information accessible.
