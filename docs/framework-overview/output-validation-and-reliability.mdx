# Output Validation and Reliability

Ensuring the reliability of agent outputs is critical, especially in production environments. Agency Swarm includes mechanisms for:

- **Response Validation**: Agents can validate outputs against predefined rules or schemas before returning them.
- **Error Handling**: Agents are designed to self-correct based on validation errors, improving reliability.
- **Tool Input/Output Validation**: Tools validate data before and after execution to reduce runtime errors.
- **Custom Validators**: Developers can implement custom validation logic within agents and tools.
