Fine-tune agent behavior by customizing prompts and providing few-shot examples.

<Info>
Custom prompts and few-shot learning help your agents understand the desired response style and content, leading to more accurate and tailored outputs.
</Info>

## Custom Prompts

### Modify Instructions

Adjust the `instructions.md` file associated with your agent to change how it responds.

<CodeBlock title="instructions.md" language="markdown">
# Agent Instructions

You are a friendly assistant that helps users with booking flights and hotels.
</CodeBlock>

### Dynamic Prompts

Programmatically alter prompts based on context or user input.

<CodeBlock title="Dynamic Prompt Example" language="python">
base_instructions = "You are an assistant who provides technical support."

additional_context = "Assist the user with troubleshooting network issues."

agent = Agent(
    name="SupportAgent",
    prompt=f"{base_instructions}\n\n{additional_context}"
)
</CodeBlock>

## Few-Shot Examples

Few-shot examples provide sample interactions to guide agent responses.

### Implementation

<CodeBlock title="Providing Few-Shot Examples" language="python">
```python
examples = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need help resetting my password."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help with that. Have you tried using the 'Forgot Password' feature?"}
]

agent = Agent(name="Helper", examples=examples)
```
</CodeBlock>

<Note>
These examples help the agent understand the expected conversation flow and response style.
</Note>
