# Customizing Prompts and Few-Shot Learning

Fine-tune agent behavior by customizing prompts and providing few-shot examples.

## Custom Prompts

- **Modify Instructions**: Adjust the `instructions.md` file to change how agents respond.
- **Dynamic Prompts**: Programmatically alter prompts based on context or user input.

## Few-Shot Examples

- **Purpose**: Provide sample interactions to guide agent responses.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  examples = [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}
  ]

  agent = Agent(name="Helper", examples=examples)  ```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures agents produce consistent and predictable outputs.
- **Adaptability**: Tailors agent responses to specific domains or styles.
