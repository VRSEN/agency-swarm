# Contributing to Agency Swarm

Each agent or tool you add to Agency Swarm will automatically be available for import by the Genesis Swarm, which will help us create an exponentially larger and smarter system.

This document provides guidelines for contributing new agents and tools to the framework.

!!! warning "Will be updated soon"
    The way we contribute agents and tools will be updated soon to load source files directly from the repository, rather than import them into the framework. This will allow you to have full control over all your agents and tools.

### Folder Structure for Tools
Tools should be added in the agency_swarm/tools/{category}/ directory like below.
Each tool should be in its specific category folder like coding, browsing, investing etc.

Your tool file should be named YourNewTool.py.
Tests should be added in agency_swarm/tests/test_tools.py.
Directory structure for a new tool:

```py
agency_swarm/tools/your-tool-category/
│
├── YourNewTool.py          # The main agent class file
└── __init__.py             # Make sure to import your tool here
```
### Adding Tests For Your Tools
For each tool, please add the following test case in agency_swarm/tests/test_tools.py:
```py
    def test_my_tool_example(self):
        output = MyCustomTool(query='John Doe').run()
        self.assertFalse("error" in output.lower())
```
### Folder Structure for Agents

Agents should be placed in agency_swarm/agents/{category}/ directory.
Each agent should have its dedicated folder named AgentName like below.
Make sure to use CamelCase for the agent name and the folder.
```python
agency_swarm/agents/your-agent-category/AgentName/
│
├── agency_manifesto.md or .txt # Agency's guiding principles (created if not exists)
└── AgentName/                  # Directory for the specific agent
    ├── files/                  # Directory for files that will be uploaded to openai (if any)
    ├── schemas/                # Directory for OpenAPI schemas to be converted into tools (if any)
    ├── AgentName.py            # The main agent class file
    ├── __init__.py             # Initializes the agent folder as a Python package
    └── instructions.md         # Instruction document for the agent
```
### Creating an Agent

Follow the structure below in your AgentName.py as a guideline.
All tools (except schemas) should be imported in AgentName.py from the agency_swarm/tools/... folder.
```python
from agency_swarm import Agent
from agency_swarm.tools.example import ExampleTool

class AgentName(Agent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # Initialize tools in kwargs if not present
        if 'tools' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['tools'] = []
        # Add required tools
        kwargs['tools'].extend([ExampleTool])

        # Set instructions
        kwargs['instructions'] = "./instructions.md"

        # Add more kwargs as needed

        # Initialize the parent class
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
```


Thank you for contributing to Agency Swarm! Your efforts help us build a more robust and versatile framework.
