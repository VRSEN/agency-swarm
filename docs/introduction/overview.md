# Overview

Agency Swarm is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the creation and orchestration of multi-agent AI systems. It employs a modular architecture that allows for flexible configuration of AI agents. Built on top of OpenAI's Assistants API, the framework focuses on creating a collaborative environment where multiple specialized agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks.

With Agency Swarm, developers can create a swarm of agents (Agencies), each with distinct roles and capabilities, that collaborate to achieve common goals. The framework provides tools for agent coordination, task management, and communication, making it easier to build complex AI systems.
