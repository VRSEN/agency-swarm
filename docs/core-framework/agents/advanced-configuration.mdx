All parameters inside the `Agent` class follow the same structure as the OpenAI Agents SDK [`Agent`](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/agent/#agents.agent.Agent). However, there are a few advanced parameters that require more explanation.

### Parallel Tool Calls

Controls whether tools execute in parallel or sequentially for a given agent.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent, ModelSettings

agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="...",
    model_settings=ModelSettings(parallel_tool_calls=False),
)
```

To force sequential execution for a specific tool regardless of that setting, set `one_call_at_a_time = True` in the tool’s `ToolConfig`. See [Advanced Tool Configuration](/core-framework/tools/custom-tools/configuration).

### File Search

If your `files_folder` ends with `_vs_<vector_store_id>`, Agency Swarm automatically associates files with that Vector Store and adds `FileSearchTool` to the Agent. The `include_search_results` behavior can be toggled via the Agent’s `include_search_results` flag.

### Output Validation

Use `output_guardrails` on the `Agent` to validate outputs. See the detailed guide: [Guardrails](/additional-features/guardrails).

### Few‑Shot Examples

You can include few‑shot examples in `instructions` as plain text or pass message history to `get_response` / `get_response_stream`.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

agent = Agent(name="MyAgent", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")

examples = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
]
new_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Can you help me write a short summary?"}

response = await agent.get_response(examples + [new_message])
```
