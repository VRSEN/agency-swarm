In the latest version, Agency Swarm leverages tools from the [agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tool/) instead of providing its own built-in tools. This provides access to a comprehensive set of production-ready tools maintained by OpenAI.

## Available Tools

The agents SDK provides the following built-in tools:

### Hosted Tools

- **`WebSearchTool`** - Lets an agent search the web
- **`FileSearchTool`** - Allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores
- **`ComputerTool`** - Allows automating computer use tasks
- **`CodeInterpreterTool`** - Lets the LLM execute code in a sandboxed environment
- **`ImageGenerationTool`** - Generates images from a prompt
- **`LocalShellTool`** - Runs shell commands on your machine

### Function Tools

- **`FunctionTool`** - Custom function-based tools using the `@function_tool` decorator

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools

- **`HostedMCPTool`** - Exposes a remote MCP server's tools to the model

**When to use each tool:**

- **Web Search**: Real-time information retrieval, current events, up-to-date data
- **File Search**: Enriching agent knowledge, reducing hallucinations, querying documents
- **Computer Tool**: Automating computer use tasks, UI interactions, testing applications
- **Code Interpreter**: Data analysis, calculations, executing code in a sandboxed environment
- **Image Generation**: Creating visual content, illustrations, design assets from prompts
- **Local Shell**: System administration, file operations, running shell commands
- **Function Tool**: Creating custom tools with specific business logic using Python functions
- **Hosted MCP Tool**: Accessing tools from remote Model Context Protocol servers

For detailed documentation and additional configuration options, refer to the [agents SDK tool documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tool/).

<Info>
v0.x is the **previous production version**. Install with: `pip install "agency-swarm<1.0.0"`
</Info>

Each agent in Agency Swarm also with some built-in tools inherited from [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant#assistants-createassistant-tools).

## Code Interpreter

Code Interpreter allows agents to execute code within a remote Jupyter Notebook environment.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import CodeInterpreter

agent = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    tools=[CodeInterpreter],
    # Other agent parameters
)
```

**When to use:**
- To perform data analysis and precise calculations.
- To handle structured files (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- To run standalone code snippets in a remote environment.

## File Search

File Search allows agents to search through their knowledge base to improve their responses. This tool uses a production-ready vector database provided by OpenAI.

```python
  from agency_swarm.tools import FileSearch

  agent = Agent(
      name="Researcher",
      tools=[FileSearch],
      # Optionally, you can specify your own vector store ID to use:
      tool_resources={
        "file_search": {
          "vector_store_ids": ["vs_abc123"],
        },
      },
      # More details can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/vector-stores/object
      # Other agent parameters
  )
  ```

**When to use:**
- To enrich your agent's knowledge about specific topics
- To reduce hallucinations by grounding agent responses in your documents
- To enable users to query their own documents
