The `ToolFactory` class allows you to create tools from different sources, such as Langchain tools or OpenAPI schemas. However, implementing tools from scratch using `BaseTool` provides greater control and is generally recommended.

<Accordion title="Import from Langchain (Not Recommended)">

```python
from langchain.tools import YouTubeSearchTool
from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory

LangchainTool = ToolFactory.from_langchain_tool(YouTubeSearchTool)
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Convert from OpenAPI Schemas">

```python
import requests
from agency_swarm.tools import ToolFactory

# Using a local OpenAPI schema file
with open("schemas/your_schema.json") as f:
    tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(f.read())

# Using an OpenAPI schema from a URL
tools = ToolFactory.from_openapi_schema(
    requests.get("https://api.example.com/openapi.json").json()
)
```

</Accordion>

## Conclusion

By leveraging the `ToolFactory`, you can streamline the process of integrating external tools into your agents. This feature allows for flexibility and rapid development, although creating tools directly with `BaseTool` is often preferable for more control and customization.

Remember to:
- **Consider Direct Implementation:** Use `BaseTool` for greater control.
- **Use ToolFactory for Quick Integration:** Ideal for rapid prototyping and integration.
