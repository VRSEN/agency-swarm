<Warning>
This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.7 and earlier)
</Warning>

Besides standard Pydantic features, you can also use a special `ToolConfig` class to customize tool behavior within the framework:

## Available `ToolConfig` Parameters

Currently, the following parameters are supported:

| Name               | Type    | Description                                                                                                      | When to Use                                                                                          | Default Value |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `one_call_at_a_time` | `bool` | Prevents concurrent execution for a specific tool. To prevent the agent from executing **any** tools concurrently, set `parallel_tool_calls=False` in the Agent class. | Use for database operations, API calls with rate limits, or actions that depend on previous results. | `False`         |
| `strict`             | `bool` | Enables strict mode, which ensures the agent will always provide **perfect** tool inputs that 100% match your schema. Has limitations. See [OpenAI Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). | Use for mission-critical tools or tools that have nested Pydantic model schemas.                     | `False`         |
| `async_mode`         | `str`  | When set to "threading," executes this tool in a separate thread.                                                  | Use when your agent needs to execute multiple tools or the same tool multiple times in a single message to decrease latency. Beware of resource allocation. | `None`          |
| `output_as_result`   | `bool` | Forces the output of this tool as the final message from the agent that called it.                                     | Only recommended for very specific use cases and only if you know what you're doing.                 | `False`         |

## Usage

To use one of the available parameters, simply add a `class ToolConfig` block to your tool class:

```python
class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    # ...

    class ToolConfig:
        one_call_at_a_time = True
        strict = False
        async_mode = "threading"
        output_as_result = True

    def run(self):
        # ...
```
