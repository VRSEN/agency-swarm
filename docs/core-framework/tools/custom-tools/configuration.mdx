Besides standard Pydantic features, you can also use a special `ToolConfig` class to customize tool behavior within the framework:

## Available `ToolConfig` Parameters

The following parameters are supported, with version compatibility noted:

| Name               | Type    | Version | Description                                                                                                      | When to Use                                                                                          | Default Value |
|--------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `one_call_at_a_time` | `bool` | All     | Prevents concurrent execution for a specific tool. To prevent the agent from executing **any** tools concurrently, set `parallel_tool_calls=False` in the Agent class. | Use for database operations, API calls with rate limits, or actions that depend on previous results. | `False`         |
| `strict`             | `bool` | All     | Enables strict mode, which ensures the agent will always provide **perfect** tool inputs that 100% match your schema. Has limitations. See [OpenAI Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). | Use for mission-critical tools or tools that have nested Pydantic model schemas.                     | `False`         |
| `async_mode`     | `str` | v0.x  | When set to "threading," executes this tool in a separate thread.  **Deprecated:** Tools are now always async in v1.x | Use when your agent needs to execute multiple tools or the same tool multiple times in a single message to decrease latency. Beware of resource allocation. | `None`      |
| `output_as_result` | `bool` | v0.x | Forces the output of this tool as the final message from the agent that called it.  **Deprecated:** No longer supported in v1.x. Use agent's `tool_use_behavior` parameter instead. | Only recommended for very specific use cases and only if you know what you're doing. | `False`    |

<Info>
**Version Changes:**
- **v1.x**: `async_mode` and `output_as_result` parameters have been removed as tools are now always asynchronous and tool output handling has been integrated into agent class.

## Usage

To use one of the available parameters, simply add a `class ToolConfig` block to your tool class:

```python
class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    # ...

    class ToolConfig:
        one_call_at_a_time = True
        strict = False
        async_mode = "threading"  # Deprecated in v1.x and newer
        output_as_result = True   # Deprecated in v1.x and newer

    def run(self):
        # ...
```
