Agency Swarm agents can interact with a wider range of tools and data sources beyond their built-in capabilities by using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. MCP is an open standard ([view specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol)) that allows agents to communicate with external services like local file systems, databases, or custom APIs, as long as those services implement the protocol.

Think of MCP as a universal translator that lets your agent talk to specialized external tools.

## Why use MCP?

*   **Access Local Resources:** Let agents read/write local files or run local commands.
*   **Connect to Custom Services:** Integrate with proprietary APIs or internal tools without writing specific Agency Swarm tool wrappers for each one, provided an MCP server exists.
*   **Leverage Existing MCP Tools:** Utilize third-party tools that already support MCP.

## Supported MCP Server Types

Agency Swarm provides helpers to connect to the two common MCP transport protocols. Choose the server type based on how your tool provider operates:

<Accordion title="MCPServerStdio: For Command-Line Tools" icon="terminal">
Use this if your tool server is a **command-line program or script**. Agency Swarm will start this program for you and communicate with it directly using its standard input/output.

*   **When to use:** Your tool is a local script, an executable, or requires running a specific command to be activated (like the standard MCP filesystem server).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCPServerSse: For Web Service Tools" icon="globe-pointer">
Use this if your tool server is already **running as a web service** at a specific **HTTP URL**. Agency Swarm connects to this URL to access tools exposed via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

*   **When to use:** Your tool is provided by a web API, a microservice, or any server accessible via an HTTP endpoint that speaks MCP+SSE (like the Python server in the demo).

## Connecting Agents to MCP Servers

To give an agent access to MCP tools, you define the server connections and pass them to the agent's `mcp_servers` list during initialization. Agency Swarm then automatically discovers the tools offered by the server and makes them available to the agent under the `name` you specified (e.g., `Filesystem_Server.list_files`).

Follow these steps:

<Accordion title="Step 1: Define Stdio Server Connection (e.g., Filesystem)">
This example shows how to configure `MCPServerStdio` to run the standard MCP filesystem tool using `npx`.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.mcp import MCPServerStdio

filesystem_server = MCPServerStdio(
    # This name determines how the agent accesses the tools (e.g., Filesystem_Server.list_files)
    name="Filesystem_Server",
    params={
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."], # Run in current directory
    },
    # cache_tools_list and strict are direct arguments for Stdio
    cache_tools_list=False,
    strict=False,

    # You can restrict the agent to using specific tools from the server by providing allowed_tools list
    allowed_tools = ["tool_1_name", "tool_2_name"]
)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Define SSE Server Connection (Optional)">
This example shows how to configure `MCPServerSse` to connect to a hypothetical web server running locally that provides tools via SSE.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools.mcp import MCPServerSse

# Assumes your SSE server is running at this URL
sse_server = MCPServerSse(
    name="My_Custom_SSE_Server", # Tools will be accessed like My_Custom_SSE_Server.some_tool
    params={
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse",
    },
    cache_tools_list=False,
    strict=False,

    # Not providing allowed_tools will attach all available tools to the agent
)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Initialize Agent with Servers">
Pass the list of configured server connections to the `mcp_servers` parameter when creating your `Agent`.

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent

# Assuming filesystem_server and sse_server are defined as above
my_mcp_agent = Agent(
    name="MCPAgent",
    description="An agent that can use filesystem and custom SSE tools.",
    instructions="Use the Filesystem_Server tools to manage files or My_Custom_SSE_Server tools for custom tasks.",
    # Pass the list of configured servers here
    mcp_servers=[filesystem_server, sse_server],
    temperature=0,
)

# Agency Swarm automatically discovers tools from the connected servers.
# Example: my_mcp_agent.tools will now include tools like
# 'Filesystem_Server.read_file', 'My_Custom_SSE_Server.get_data', etc.
```
</Accordion>


## Runnable Demo

For a practical, runnable example using both `MCPServerStdio` and `MCPServerSse`, see the `demo_mcp.py` script located in the `tests/demos/` directory of the Agency Swarm repository.

*   **Remember:** The demo requires you to run the example SSE server ([server.py](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/tests/scripts/server.py)) in a separate terminal first.

## Key Takeaways

*   MCP connects agents to external tools/data via standard protocols (Stdio, SSE).
*   Use `MCPServerStdio` for command-line tool servers and `MCPServerSse` for URL-based tool servers.
*   Define server connections using the appropriate class, providing `name`, `params`, and optionally configuring `strict` and `cache_tools_list`.
*   Pass configured server instances to the `Agent`'s `mcp_servers` parameter during initialization.
*   The `name` you give a server connection becomes the prefix for its tools (e.g., `MyServerName.tool_name`).
*   External MCP servers (especially SSE ones) must be running separately for the agent to connect to them.
