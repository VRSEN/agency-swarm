## Agent State Management

With the new https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python, agents (formerly assistants) are now stateless - eliminating the need to save and pass agent settings for chat persistence. The framework only needs to maintain the conversation history, which Agency Swarm manages through its thread system.

## Thread State Management

Since managing conversation state is now a responsibility of the developer in the Agents SDK, the Agency Swarm framework has introduced a thread management system to handle, automate, and simplify history management. All agent outputs are processed and stored locally to allow for seamless agency usage within a single session. To maintain persistence across multiple sessions, the framework also provides convenient callback methods that require minimal input to set up.

## Agent State Management

In OpenAI Assistants API, all agents need to be updated before they can be used. Agency Swarm manages this by maintaining a local `settings.json` file, and the comparing local settings with the ones stored on OpenAI's servers. If there are any differences, the Assistants are updated on OpenAI's servers. This ensures that the agents are only created once, and are only updated when needed.

## Thread State Management

Additionally, OpenAI's Assistants API manages the conversation context through threads. A thread represents a persistent conversation between an assistant and a user, automatically handling the storage and truncation of messages to fit within the model's context window. This approach offloads the complexity of conversation state management to OpenAI, ensuring efficient and seamless context handling.
