## Agent State Management

With the new https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python, agents (formerly assistants) are now stateless - eliminating the need to save and pass agent settings for chat persistence. The framework only needs to maintain the conversation history, which Agency Swarm manages through its thread system.

## Thread State Management

Since managing conversation state is now a responsibility of the developer in the Agents SDK, the Agency Swarm framework has introduced a thread management system to handle, automate, and simplify history management. All agent outputs are processed and stored locally to allow for seamless agency usage within a single session. To maintain persistence across multiple sessions, the framework also provides convenient callback methods that require minimal input to set up.

## Agent State Management (Assistants API)

This section applies to older versions (v0.x). In OpenAI Assistants API, all agents needed to be updated before they could be used. Agency Swarm managed this by maintaining a local `settings.json` file and comparing local settings with the ones stored on OpenAI's servers. If there were any differences, the Assistants were updated on OpenAI's servers.

## Thread State Management (Assistants API)

Additionally, OpenAI's Assistants API managed the conversation context through threads. A thread represented a persistent conversation between an assistant and a user, automatically handling the storage and truncation of messages to fit within the model's context window.
