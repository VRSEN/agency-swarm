Agency in Agency Swarm is a collection of agents that can collaborate with one another.

## Benefits of Using an Agency

Utilizing an Agency consisting of multiple agents offers several benefits:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Fewer Hallucinations" icon="bug" iconType="solid">
  Agents within an agency can supervise each other, reducing mistakes and handling unexpected scenarios more effectively.
</Card>

<Card title="Complex Tasks" icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid">
  Adding more agents allows for longer sequences of actions, enabling the completion of more complex tasks before delivering results to the user.
</Card>

<Card title="Scalability" icon="arrow-up-right-dots" iconType="solid">
  Agencies allow you to scale your solutions seamlessly by adding more agents, as the complexity of your system grows.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Start with a minimal number of agents. Fine-tune them to ensure they function correctly before adding more.
  Introducing too many agents initially can make debugging and understanding interactions challenging.

In the latest version, the Agency class orchestrates a collection of `Agent` instances based on a defined structure. It provides enhanced thread management, persistence hooks, and improved communication patterns between agents.

## Agency Parameters

Overview of parameters in the new `Agency` class:

| Name | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Entry Points | `*entry_points_args` | Positional arguments representing Agent instances that serve as entry points for external interaction. These agents can be directly messaged by users. |
| Communication Flows *(optional)* | `communication_flows` | List of (sender, receiver) tuples defining allowed agent-to-agent message paths. Example: `[(ceo, dev), (ceo, va)]`. Default: `None` |
| Name *(optional)* | `name` | A name for the agency instance. Default: `None` |
| Shared Instructions *(optional)* | `shared_instructions` | Instructions prepended to all agents' system prompts. Default: `None` |
| Send Message Tool Class *(optional)* | `send_message_tool_class` | Custom SendMessage tool class to use for all agents that don't have their own send_message_tool_class set. Enables enhanced inter-agent communication patterns. Default: `None` |
| Load Threads Callback *(optional)* | `load_threads_callback` | A callable to load conversation threads for persistence. Default: `None` |
| Save Threads Callback *(optional)* | `save_threads_callback` | A callable to save conversation threads for persistence. Default: `None` |
| User Context *(optional)* | `user_context` | Initial shared context accessible to all agents during runs. Default: `None` |

### Deprecated Parameters

The following parameters are deprecated and will issue warnings:

- `agency_chart` - Use positional entry points and `communication_flows` instead
- `shared_files` - Shared file handling is not currently implemented
- `async_mode` - Asynchronous execution is handled by the underlying SDK
- `settings_path` & `settings_callbacks` - Responses SDK is now stateless, so agency settings are no longer needed.
- `threads_callbacks` - Use `load_threads_callback` and `save_threads_callback` directly
- Agent-level parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, etc.) - Set these on individual Agent instances

## Example

Quick example of how to create an agency with 3 agents using the new structure:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from .ceo import CEO
from .developer import Developer
from .virtual_assistant import VirtualAssistant

ceo = CEO()
dev = Developer()
va = VirtualAssistant()

# New structure: entry points as positional args, communication flows as keyword arg
agency = Agency(
    ceo, dev,  # Entry points - these agents can interact with users
    communication_flows=[
        (ceo, dev),  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
        (ceo, va),   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
        (dev, va)    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
    ],
    shared_instructions="You are part of a collaborative agency focused on software development.",
    user_context={"project_type": "web_application"}
)
```

## Agency Parameters

Overview of parameters in `Agency` class:

| Name | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Agency Chart | `agency_chart` | A list that defines the hierarchy and interaction patterns between agents. It specifies:<br/>1. Individual agents that can interact with users<br/>2. Agent pairs that can communicate with each other<br/><br/>Example: `[agent1, [agent1, agent2]]`<br/>- `agent1` has user interaction permissions<br/>- `agent1` can communicate with `agent2` |
| Shared Instructions *(optional)* | `shared_instructions` | Path to a file containing instructions shared across all agents. Can be a relative path from the agency's folder or an absolute path. Default: empty string |
| Shared Files *(optional)* | `shared_files` | Path to a folder or list of folders containing files accessible by all agents. These files are added to each agent's files folder. Default: `None` |
| Async Mode *(optional)* | `async_mode` | Specifies the asynchronous processing mode. Options:<br/>- `"threading"`: All sub-agents run in separate threads<br/>- `"tools_threading"`: All tools run in separate threads, but agents do not<br/>Default: `None` |
| Settings Path *(optional)* | `settings_path` | Path to the JSON settings file for the agency. If file doesn't exist, it will be created. Default: `"./settings.json"` |
| Settings Callbacks *(optional)* | `settings_callbacks` | Dictionary containing functions to load and save settings. Must include both `"load"` and `"save"` functions. Both functions must be defined. Default: `None` |
| Threads Callbacks *(optional)* | `threads_callbacks` | Dictionary containing functions to load and save threads. Must include both `"load"` and `"save"` functions. Both functions must be defined. Default: `None` |
| Temperature *(optional)* | `temperature` | Controls response randomness (0.0 to 1.0). Agent-specific values override this. Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic. Default: `0.3` |
| Top P *(optional)* | `top_p` | Alternative to temperature for controlling response randomness (0.0 to 1.0). Agent-specific values override this. Default: `1.0` |
| Max Prompt Tokens *(optional)* | `max_prompt_tokens` | Maximum tokens allowed in the prompt for each agent. Agent-specific values override this. Default: `None` |
| Max Completion Tokens *(optional)* | `max_completion_tokens` | Maximum tokens allowed in the completion for each agent. Agent-specific values override this. Default: `None` |
| Truncation Strategy *(optional)* | `truncation_strategy` | Dictionary configuring how to handle token limits. Agent-specific values override this. See [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun#runs-createrun-truncation_strategy) for details. Default: `None` |

    ceo, dev  # CEO and Developer will be the entry point for communication with the user
    [ceo, dev],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
    [ceo, va],   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
    [dev, va]    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
])
