When it comes to running your agency, you have 3 options:

1. **CopilotKit/AG-UI Interface**: The most modern and recommended way to get started.
2. **Get Completion**: For backend or custom integrations.
3. **Terminal Version**: Best for quick debugging and testing.

## Pre-requisites for CopilotKit/AG-UI Demo

To use the CopilotKit/AG-UI demo (`copilot_demo()`), make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or newer recommended): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

If these requirements are not met, the demo will not start and you will see an error message.

## CopilotKit/AG-UI Interface

To open a CopilotKit interface, use the `copilot_demo` method:

```python
agency.copilot_demo()
```

This will launch both the backend and a Next.js frontend. Simply follow the `localhost` link from the terminal to start using your agency in a chat-based UI.

## Get Completion

To get a response from your agency directly in code, use the `get_completion` method:

```python
response = agency.get_completion("I want you to build me a website",
                                 additional_instructions="This is an additional instruction for the task.",
                                 tool_choice={"type": "function", "function": {"name": "SendMessage"}},
                                 attachments=[],
                                 recipient_agent=dev,
                                 )
print(response)
```

**Parameters**:

- `message`: The message to send to the agency.
- `additional_instructions` (optional): Additional instructions that will be appended at the end of instructions for the recipient agent.
- `tool_choice` (optional): Force the recipient agent to use a specific tool.
- `attachments` (optional): A list of attachments to be sent with the message, following [OpenAI format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage#messages-createmessage-attachments).
- `recipient_agent` (optional): The agent to which the message should be sent.

## Terminal Version

To run the agency directly from your terminal, use the `terminal_demo` method:

```bash
agency.terminal_demo()
```
<Tip>
When using the terminal to run the agency, you can send messages directly to any top-level agent by using the "mentions" feature. To do this, start your message with the agent's name preceded by an @ symbol (for example, `@Developer I want you to build me a website`). This directs your message to the specified agent instead of the CEO. You can also press the tab key to autocomplete the agent's name.
</Tip>

## Deleting Agency

If you would like to delete the agency and all associated files, vector stores, and assistants on OpenAI, you can use the `delete` method:

```python
agency.delete()
```
