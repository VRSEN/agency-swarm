## Shared Instructions (Agency Manifesto)

The `agency_manifesto.md` file contains instructions that will be shared among all agents in the agency.

Here is a template to help get you started:

```markdown
# Agency Manifesto

[Description of your agency]

## Mission Statement

[Your mission statement]

## Operating Environment

[Description of your operating environment]
```

To use the manifesto, simply specify the path to your manifesto in the `Agency` class.

```python
agency = Agency(
    agency_chart=[...],
    shared_instructions='agency_manifesto.md',
    ...
)
```

## Shared Files
<Warning>
This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.x)
</Warning>

Shared files allow you to share certain files among all agents in the agency. All your agents will than be able to use these files with `FileSearch` and `CodeInterpreter` tools.

To use shared files, simply put them in a folder and specify the folder path in a `shared_files` parameter.

```python
agency = Agency([ceo], shared_files='my_shared_files_folder')
```

## Default Parameters
<Warning>
This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.x)
</Warning>

Some parameters in `Agency` class mimic those in `Agent` class.

**In case if the parameter is defined in both classes, the value from `Agent` class will be used.**

```python
agency = Agency([ceo], temperature=0.3, max_prompt_tokens=25000)
```

You can use the following parameters to set default values for the entire agency:

- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `max_completion_tokens`
- `max_prompt_tokens`
- `truncation_strategy`

## Custom Settings Path
<Warning>
This feature is only available for older versions of the library (v0.x)
</Warning>

By default, Agency Swarm keeps the state of your agents in a special `settings.json` file. If you would like to use a different file path for settings, you can specify a `settings_path` parameter:

```python
agency = Agency([ceo], settings_path='my_settings.json')
```

If this file does not exist, it will be created, along with new Assistants on your OpenAI account.
