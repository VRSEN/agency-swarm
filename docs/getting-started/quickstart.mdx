Get up and running with Agency Swarm quickly by following these steps:

## Import Modules and Set Up

1. **Import the necessary modules**:
   ```python
   from agency_swarm import Agent, Agency   ```

2. **Set Your OpenAI Key**:
   ```python
   from agency_swarm import set_openai_key
   set_openai_key("YOUR_API_KEY")   ```

## Start from Scratch

1. **Create Tools**: Define your custom tools with [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).  
   All tools must extend the `BaseTool` class and implement the `run` method.
   ```python
   from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool
   from pydantic import Field

   class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
       """
       A brief description of what the custom tool does. 
       The docstring should clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality.
       It will be used by the agent to determine when to use this tool.
       """

       example_field: str = Field(
           ..., description="Description of the example field, explaining its purpose and usage for the Agent."
       )

       def run(self):
           """
           The implementation of the run method, where the tool's main functionality is executed.
           """
           # Your custom tool logic goes here
           do_something(self.example_field)
           return "Result of MyCustomTool operation"
   ```

2. **Define Agent Roles**: Create your agents with specific roles and responsibilities.
   ```python
   from agency_swarm import Agent

   ceo = Agent(
       name="CEO",
       description="Responsible for client communication, task planning, and management.",
       instructions="path/to/instructions.md",  # can be a string or file path
       tools=[],
       temperature=0.5,
       max_prompt_tokens=25000,
   )

   developer = Agent(
       name="Developer",
       description="Responsible for executing tasks and providing feedback.",
       instructions="You must execute the tasks provided by the CEO and provide feedback.",
       tools=[MyCustomTool]
   )   ```

3. **Create an Agency**:
   ```python
   agency = Agency([
       ceo,
       [ceo, developer],
   ], shared_instructions='You are a part of an AI development agency.\n\n')   ```
        
    !!! note "Note on Communication Flows"
         Communication flows are directional, established from left to right in the agency_chart definition. The CEO can initiate a chat with the developer (dev) who can respond, but the developer cannot initiate a chat with the CEO.

4. **Run the Agency**:
    Choose your preferred interface:

    - **Web interface**:
        ```python
        agency.demo_gradio(height=900)   ```
        
    - **Terminal version**:
        ```python
        agency.run_demo()   ```
        
    - **Backend version**:
        ```python
        completion_output = agency.get_completion("Please create a new website for our client.", yield_messages=False)   ```

## Use Genesis Agency

1. **Run the `genesis` command**:
    ```bash
    agency-swarm genesis [--openai_key "YOUR_API_KEY"]   ```
