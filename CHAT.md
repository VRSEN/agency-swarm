You are an expert software developer.  Design an multi AI agent (agency) solution using the agency-swarm github repo by VRSEN.  This agency will automatically manage a social media account starting with a focus on YouTube.  The agents will create short form social media content for YouTube Shorts.  The first use case will be creating viral clips from content from the Shawn Ryan Show youtube channel.  The agency should be able to download the videos and analyze the video to identify viral segments that can be animated using AI tools and used in a side by side layout short form video where the original youtube video is on one side and the AI animated scene on the other side.  There should be a text caption displaying the transcript as the video is playing.

The main goal of the agency is to grow the channel to gain revenue.  

You are now an expert viral short form social media marketer emulating the skills of Musa Mustafa co owner of crayo.ai.  Create a marketing campaign that can be followed in conjunctioin with the application development roadmap.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want a multi-agent system using the agency-swarm framework to manage a YouTube channel, specifically creating Shorts from the Shawn Ryan Show. The main goal is channel growth and revenue.
First, I need to outline the agents required. The user mentioned downloading videos, analyzing for viral segments, animating those segments, and creating side-by-side videos with captions. So, I'll need agents for each of these tasks: Content Acquisition, Analysis, Creative, Production, Publishing, and Analytics.
Next, the architecture. Agency-swarm uses a hierarchical structure with a CEO agent overseeing specialized agents. Each agent has a specific role and tools. I'll map out each agent's responsibilities and the tools they might use, like yt-dlp for downloading, Whisper for transcription, GPT-4 for analysis, Runway ML for animation, etc.
For the marketing campaign, the user referenced Musa Mustafa's strategies. Key points include audience analysis to target Shawn Ryan's existing fans, content strategy focusing on high-impact moments, SEO optimization with keywords, consistent posting schedule, engagement tactics like hooks and CTAs, cross-promotion, monetization through YouTube's Partner Program, and analytics for optimization.
I need to ensure the agents align with the marketing steps. For example, the Analysis Agent identifies viral clips based on emotional cues, which ties into the content strategy. The Creative Agent adds hooks and CTAs, supporting engagement tactics. The Publishing Agent handles SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.
I should also consider the development roadmap, breaking it into phases: setup, core features, advanced features, and scaling. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring a structured approach. Testing and iteration are crucial, so including A/B testing and feedback loops in the Analytics Agent makes sense.
Potential challenges include ensuring seamless integration between agents, handling large video processing efficiently, and maintaining content quality. Tools like FFmpeg and MoviePy are good for video processing, but might need optimization for scalability.
Monetization is a key goal, so the roadmap includes enabling monetization features once the channel meets requirements. Affiliate marketing and sponsorships are additional revenue streams to consider later.
Finally, the marketing campaign needs to be actionable alongside development. Each marketing step should have corresponding agent support, ensuring the system not only creates content but also optimizes for growth and revenue continuously.
